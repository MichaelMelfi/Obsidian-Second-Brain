1. A loaf of bread that has been freshly baked being taken out the over
Sujin - The Over might be me?
        Jesus is the one taking out the fresh bread from me, taking out new and fresh revelations
   - I think this takes about a freshness in my life being cooked and finished, I have become something fresh and now ready to go out into the world.     

3. Me on a massive motorway with 1000s driving past, I am trying to divert the traffic down another lane but only a few are going down it.
   Jesus comes over and opens the lane even more and almost everyone starts going through
Sujin - I took down the Barriers during my fasting but Jesus has taken down the rest of the barriers in my life and through that it will lead a lot more to do the same.
- I think this talks that if I start it and do as much as I can Jesus will do the rest. I cannot only do it with my strength but through Gods strength.

1. A butterfly coming out of its cocoon and it flys  away but this one butterfly also wakes up the  rest of the butterflyâ€™s and gets them out of the cocoons and leads them into freedom.

2. Pick up your staff.
- This can come from Exodus 14:6
- This can come from Exodus 4:2-9
- This can come from Acts 28:3


1. I will pastor Citygate and through me there will be missions being sent out.
Stick with Sujin and stay his friend for he will help.

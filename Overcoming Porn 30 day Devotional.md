## Day 2 Strongholds
>'For the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh but have divine power to destroy strongholds. We destroy arguments and every lofty opinion raised against the knowledge of God, and take every thought captive to obey Christ, '
==2 Corinthians 10:4-5==
https://www.bible.com/bible/59/2CO.10.4-5


1. List out the lies that you consistently tell yourself that contribute to you staying stuck and replace them with the truth (lies that are unaddressed become strongholds)
- God still loves me
==Yes and He always will but if you love Him you wouldn't want to hurt Him==
- He will still use me
==I am easily swapped out for someone else. He always has  backups==
- This is the last time
==I've said this for so many years. stop lying to yourself==
- Everyone struggles with it
==Yes everyone might struggle with it but, I don't have to.== 
- It doesn't matter
==It is sinning, of course it matters. You might be forgiven but it doesn't mean forgotten.==
==It matters to my future family and Elise.==
- Its normal
==It might be normal to the world but we are either for the world of against the world. I cannot be both. It is not normal for Christians.==

2. Do you have someone to tell?
Yes, I have told Tim and Elise
>'Therefore, confess your sins to one another and pray for one another, that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous person has great power as it is working. '
==James 5:16==

# Preaching Ideas - Unified Prayer


Every revival starts with an unusual amount of unified prayer.

  

1989 there was a study of 300 different locations that had revival either poor or rich all in different locations and countries and they wanted to find out what happened before the revival.

They found one thing the same in every place and it was that is started with an unusual unified prayer.

What we mean by unusual is that they pray as a group ALOT. Not your quiet time but together as a group.

Quote from DR A.T.Pierson

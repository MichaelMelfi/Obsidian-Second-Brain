# Preaching Idea - Do You Realise What You Have

Back in the Old Testament, They had the Tabernacle which was the only way they could speak to God.
Only Priest’s were allowed in.
If anyone else went into the Tabernacle who wasn’t ordained **THEY WOULD DIE**

Jesus used the Holy Spirit and faith for this works and miracles.
**We have that inside us**
We are the **TEMPLE OF THE HOLY SPIRIT** 
This means the Tabernacle is inside us!

It is like a car, you have a McLaren p1 and it is fully customised.
But all you ever do with that car is drive it around a car park at 5mph
YOU ARE NOT USING THAT CAR TO ITS FULL POTENTIAL, its original design.
When you accept God into your life and you realise what you can do he will let you loose.

# Preaching Ideas

The Disciples didn’t know why they had to get a donkey however they did it and because they did, Jesus was able to fullfill the prophecy of him riding the donkey into the city on Palm Sunday.

Do not ask God why. JUST DO

The thing that you dont understand might be the very thing that causes a prophecy or a word in someone’s life to come to pass.

STORY:
There was a group from a DTS and they all listened to Gods voice.
the leader goes around the group and asks what they hear
They all had scriptures but there was one guy who said I had a weird voice telling me that I have to do a headstand next to a free.
He had no idea why that was what he heard.

So they went to park and did just that.

There was a man who was praying, and said earlier that day, i do not want to be here anymore.
If i see someone who is doing a headstand next to a tree i will give my life to you.

The man went to the park and saw the kid doing the headstand next to the tree.
So the kid then lead this man to the lord through prayer etc.

The DTS student did not know why he was doing what he was doing but he trusted God and didn’t ask questions. Just like in the bible when the disciples had to go and get a donkey and didn’t know why Jesus was telling them to get it.

# Preaching Ideas - What are you laying down

Where is Palm Sunday?
Matthew 21:1-11
Mark 11:1-11
Luke 19:28-44
John 12:12-19

They laid down their clothes!
Back in those days they did not have a wardrobe unless they were very rich!
For the average person, all they had was the clothes they were wearing
They only have one outfit
And they were places this at His feet because they knew what he was and what he is
They knew he was so special that they would take off all they had and lay it on the floor for Him

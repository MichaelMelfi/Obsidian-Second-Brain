# Preaching Ideas - Psalm 1
>1 “Oh, the joys of those who do not 
> follow the advice of the wicked,
> or stand around with sinners, 
> or join in with mockers. 
> 2 But they delight in the law of the Lord, 
> meditating on it day and night. 
> 3 They are like trees planted along the riverbank, 
> bearing fruit each season. 
> Their leaves never wither, 
> and they prosper in all they do. 
> 4 But not the wicked! 
> They are like worthless chaff, scattered by the wind. 
> 5 They will be condemned at the time of judgment.
> Sinners will have no place among the godly.
> 6 For the Lord watches over the path of the godly,
> but the path of the wicked leads to destruction.”

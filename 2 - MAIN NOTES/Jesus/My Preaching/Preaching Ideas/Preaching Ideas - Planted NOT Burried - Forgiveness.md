# Preaching Ideas - Planted NOT Burried

I can’t read the whole story but I would like to talk about the story of Joseph in Genesis.

In summary Joseph is the youngest son of 12 Brothers, and his dad Jacob loved him so much that he actually gets special treatment over the other brothers. 
One day Joseph had a dream that all of his brothers would bow to him.
Because of this his brothers got very annoyed and jealous so they ended up selling him into slavery.
And lied to their dad saying that Joseph got killed.

After a little while of being a slave Joseph ended up in prison in Egypt where he spent many years of his life.
He ended up helping people understand their dreams/ prophecies they were having in the prison because he was gifted by God at interpreting the dreams.

Because of this he ended up helping the Pharo of Egypt and saved the nation through a prophecy he had said and because of this he ended up being Pharos right hand man. He was the 2nd most powerful person in Egypt.

But during all this There was one thing that was constant through being in prison, through ups and the downs he stayed faithful to God

God used Josephs injustice to not just save himself but to save his family and brothers and bless everyone through Joseph.

If Joseph was not faithful and forgiving to his brothers, there would not have been the 12 tribes of Israel and God plan wouldn’t have worked! It saved Israel by just forgivness
What are you robbing or stopping from someones or your own life if you don’t forgive them?
Forgive everyone as you don't know what Gods plan is and what that can lead to.

Joseph named his sons
Ephraim which means - Fruitfulness even through anything
And Mannaseh which means - He who forgets
This means that he named his sons ‘I will forget every injustice and be fruitful through everything.

“Many are the plans of man but the plans of God will provail.”

Jesus said “Forgive them father for they do not know what they do!”
We have to be the exact same.

There was a lady who was in a concentration camp
She became a pastor
And one of the officers who she remembered was one of the curliest came to her church and accepted the gospel.
He came forward and asked for her to pray for him that he is forgiven by God and by her for everything he did to the Jewish people (He did not recognise her but she recognised him)
She didn’t want to forgive him but she said Jesus if you can forgive him then i can to.
And by faith she forgave him and grabbed his hand and prayed for him.
She said she felt the love of God and that it went from her hand to her heart.
Forgiveness is not about our feelings
Faith first, feelings second.

Get them to repeat a prayer of forgiveness and release someone or something to God

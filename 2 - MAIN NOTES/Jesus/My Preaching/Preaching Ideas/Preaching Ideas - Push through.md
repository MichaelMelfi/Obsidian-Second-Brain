##### What Did I Learn From This Teaching?:


# Preaching Ideas - Push through

Abraham - “Is anything too hard for the lord?” - 
What miracle are you grabbing hold of today?
 Do not wait, if you wait you might miss your chance.

Woman of the blood - she didn’t care what everyone thought, she pushed through the crowed and grabbed her healing

Zakious in the tree - He climbed a tree to make sure he could see and hear Jesus talk

The blind begger - He heard Jesus was walking past, he shouted and everyone told him to be quiet, he then shouted again and made Jesus hear him even though everyone else was telling him to shush.

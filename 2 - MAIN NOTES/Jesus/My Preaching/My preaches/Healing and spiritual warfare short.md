Teaching on healing but also spiritual warfare because they almost go hand in hand.

==All of us as a team have seen some sort of demon and seen healings, like many of you here.==
Man who walk
Woman who was colour blind
I was healed
Mum WAS healed of breast cancer

==But it’s not us who heals them, it is God who works His power through us.==

### Spiritual world and the enemy
==We must know that the spiritual world is real and Satan is real.==
We need a strong knowledge of our enemy and that our enemy is defeated.
Not just knowledge but revelation.
satan wants us to think that he is stronger than he actually is
And that he is not scared of anything

==BUT SATAN, DEMONS AND IDOLS ARE TERRIFIED OF JESUS==
The one thing i want you guys to get out of this teaching is how 
==one sided the fight between Jesus and satan is
that you have the authority to cast out demons and heal the sick.==
Demons even actually have to bow to Jesus.

==We must have a biblical view not a world view on spiritual warfare and health== and the spiritual world.
If we don‘t know the bible, we wont know how to fight, and be afraid of anything that happens or if you run into the enemy.

The enemy might be bigger than me
But It doesn’t matter how strong you are or how much power you have, every time you pray and ==Battle the enemy, Jesus is right next to you!==
==Satan and demons are terrified of Jesus.==

### Jesus
Jesus was crucified and killed on the cross which washed our sins and shame away with His perfect blood.
When He went to hell itself, He didn’t stay dead He rose from the dead 3 days later and took back the keys of death, hell and the grave.

==Jesus is alive right now, He is not dead.==
And when you accept Jesus as your Lord and Saviour, It says in the bible that He now lives in you.
So everything Jesus could do, you can now do.
You can cast out demons
You can heal the sick
You now have all power through Jesus and you now have all authority through Jesus.
When you pray, it is like Jesus is praying.

It says in the bible:
> ““Truly, truly, I say to you, ==whoever believes in me will also do the works that I do; and greater works than these will he do==, because I am going to the Father. Whatever you ask in my name, this I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If you ask me anything in my name, I will do it.”
‭‭==John‬ ‭14‬:‭12‬-‭14‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/jhn.14.12-14.ESV

> “And he said to them, “Go into all the world and proclaim the gospel to the whole creation. Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned. And these signs will accompany those who believe: ==in my name they will cast out demons;== they will speak in new tongues; they will pick up serpents with their hands; ==and if they drink any deadly poison, it will not hurt them; they will lay their hands on the sick, and they will recover.””==
‭‭==Mark‬ ‭16‬:‭15‬-‭18‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/mrk.16.15-18.ESV

==THIS IS FOR ANYONE THAT IS SAVED.==
==It does not matter who you are.==
It doesn’t say only preachers.
Missionaries
Teachers
Special people  men
It says will accompany ANYONE who believes.
==Everyone here if you have accepted Jesus as your lord and saviour can:==
cast our demons, 
everyone here can heal other people who are sick and also themselves.
==Now you still need community,== you still need people to stand with you pray with you and fight with you but you are all the power yourself!

> “He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we might die to sin and live to righteousness. ==By his wounds you have been healed.”==
==‭‭1 Peter‬ ‭2‬:‭24‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/1pe.2.24.ESV

==Through Jesus you are already healed.==
A lot of us think like we are sick and we are trying to get healed BUT
I want you to think of it like you are already healed and the enemy is trying to make you sick.

==The way the enemy can come into our lives.==
==Un-forgiveness==
Hate and un-forgiveness is the same as you drinking poison and hoping the person you are hating gets killed.
==Sin==
==witch craft/curses== (blood sacrifices)

#### How to cast out an evil spirit or heal // learning from Jesus.

==All demons that came to Jesus were cast out and rebuked.==
All He would say is simple things like ‘Come out of him’ Or ‘leave’
It’s not about how many words you say, it’s about the authority you say it with.

==This is the same with healing.==
Every single person in the New Testament that went to Jesus for healing, was healed.
He healed crowds of people at once and He also healed individuals.
And all he would say is ‘Be healed’
It’s not about saying the perfect words but about the heart and faith you say it with.

1. ==Calm down!==
Welcome God into the place.
The enemy wants our attention and wants to create a crazy environment.
Tell the demon to shush and be quiet!

2. ==Tell the Demon to flee! Or be healed==
All power has been given to Jesus and in the great Commision He gave us all authority over evil spirits and baptising and creating desciples.
Our confidence isn’t in us but is in Jesus for He has the name above every name!
Just like Jesus did

3.  ==Keep your eyes open==
So you can see what is happening.
You want to see what God is doing.

4. ==Watch for freedom or healing==
You will be able to tell when they are free.
If you do not know if they are free they are most likely not free yet!
If it is healing, always ask them to do something that they couldn’t do before ETC
Lift arm or walk.

5. ==Do Not Give Up==
Sometimes it can take a second, other times it can take hours.
Maybe pray multiple times for healing.

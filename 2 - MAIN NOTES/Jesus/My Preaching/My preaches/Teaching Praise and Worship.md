## Praise
### What is Praise?
==Man paying for your debt like Jesus example of what praise is==
Imagine you were in 1,000,000 debt and a man came over to you and gave you the money to pay it and wanted nothing in return.
Now imagine Jesus coming up to you face to face and said I have paid for all of your sin, because of what i have done you are now not going to hell, you are a child of God, you are free.
The excitement you get from that is what praise is!
Praise is giving God Glory and for everything he has done for you.

I’ve loved watching you guys praise and worship in the morning with us, but I’ve seen some of you dancing more for the rap and Cambodian music than you do for God.

==David in the bible.==
He is know as the best king that has ever been.
He was Gods chosen king who defeated loads of enemies and saved Gods people.
Do you want to know what His secret was?
Prayer, praise and worship and giving God glory.
He actually wrote 73 psalms in the bible which are songs about God.
Even with how busy he was he still made sure he even wrote songs for God.

2 Samuel 6
David finally had the ark of God returned to him which was God presence and because He finally had God back he danced so so much that people around him thought he was weird strange.
Even his wife told him to stop!
I celebrated before the lord and Yes, I am willing to look even more foolish than this,I will even feel humiliated in my own eyes

He did not care what people thought about what he looked like or what he was doing.
You should not care what your friends think, left or right of you.
You should not fear man and being judged by man but only fear God.

## WORSHIP
Praise is thanking God for what he has done
Worship is laying everything down for him and giving Him your life.

==Get your booty off the throne==
Worship is saying, i put down my own wants, desires and only focus on what You want.
God must be the only thing you worship.
Everyone here worships something, if you are not worshiping God then someone or something is above God in your life.
We call is get your booty off the throne.
Some of you, you give God your Sunday at church to God but then as soon as your leave church or every other day of the week there is something else that you think of more than God.
This could be your phones, a person, addictions, money.
And even yourself.
But no, the only person who should be on the throne of your life is God.
Worship is a constant thing, your life should be a worship/living sacrifice  to God.
That what ever God wants, you will do and be for Him.

==Worship in a music context is:==
This is a time for only you and God.
It is such an intimate time.
This is a time to talk to God
Ask God what he wants of you
Cry to God

There is no right way to worship.
everyone is different, some people are loud, some people are quiet.
Worship is your and Gods time only

You can worship by lifting up your hands in surrender saying, God i give you my life.
someone said that lifting up their hands in worship make them feel like there is a freshness of Gods presence that they feel.
Some might kneel down because God is worthy of everything and He is our Lord and saviour.
Some might cry
Some might shout

But if someone said they loved you and (Example) 
But then someone else did (Example)
Who do you think loved the person more?
You actions speak louder than words

So we are going to sing a couple of songs and i want you to really focus on God

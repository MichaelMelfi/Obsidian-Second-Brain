I have been asked to give a teaching on specifically healing but this will go over your authority and power as a believer Because when we accept Jesus as our lord and saviour we are a complete new creation. Our old self dies and our new self is born.
In you lives God and all his power and authority.
When you accept God into your life, you are no longer a normal human being but a Child of God God works through you
Because God uses us to do His will/wants/needs

This can be:
Sharing the gospel
Preaching
Teaching
Performing miracles
Healings

And anything He wishes.
And this applies to everyone who has accepted Jesus into their lives.
It is not only for pastors, preachers, missionaries or special people but ANYONE who has accepted Jesus into their life.

I’ve seen a lot of healings:
woman who was colour blind
Man walking again
I was healed
My mum and dad were both healed

You’ve Got to remember that it isn’t us who healed them but God through us.
It is not our strength but Gods strength
Wisdom
Courage
Power
Authority

# Teaching - Prayer and Worship

PRAYER
Prayer is a conversation/connection between you and God
Pray with faith!
The Lordâ€™s Prayer
When you pray, things change! Lives are changed, families are changed, countries are changed!
Every revival has started with prayer
Pray without ceasing, prayer should be your first go to, not your last resort!

PRAISE and WORSHIP
Praise and worship
The difference, praise is giving praise to God, this is where we go to battle and where we defeat enemies

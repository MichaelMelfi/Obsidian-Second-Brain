Why am i saying this?
Because God lives inside of us.
When we speak we speak with the authority or God
When we pray we pray with the authority of God.
Everything we do is through the strength of God.

Im sure we have all heard of Jesus right?
Before we get to what Jesus did and the power and authority we have as believers.
We must know why we have that authority and power.

Jesus came to earth to defeat Satan and cleanse us of our sins and create a way for us to be saved all through His blood and His Sacrifice on the cross.
Before Jesus people would have to sacrifice their animals to cleanse themselves of the sins they have committed just like they do here.
But because of Jesus’ blood, His blood is the perfect blood that has cleansed us believers of all our sins forever.

When Jesus was in Hell, He was in hell for 3 days.
During those 3 days He didn’t just take our place in hell for us but he bore all of our sin and sickness.
This means that during those three days


==Two marks of Jesus' ministry :==
​i)  Absolute Love for Mankind and everyone no matter who they are.
​ii)  Absolute hatred for the Devil and his works

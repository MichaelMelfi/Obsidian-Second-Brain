- This is where you stand against satan and his demons
- Jesus already got the victory and we have victory through Him!
- When we are battling, we are not praying and fighting FOR the victory but FROM a place a victory through Jesus!
- Jesus defeated the enemy, he disarmed them and shamed them. The enemy has nothing to fight with!

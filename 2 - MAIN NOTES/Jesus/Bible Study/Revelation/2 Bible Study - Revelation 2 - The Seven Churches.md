# Bible Study - Revelation 2 - The Seven Churches

## The patterns of the Seven Church letters
1. The Address to the Messenger or Angel of the church
2. A statement about Jesus
3. A statement addressing the condition o the church
4. A pronouncement regarding the condition
5. An instruction from Jesus to the church
6. A general exhortation
7. A promised reward

## The Prophetic Interpretation of the Seven Churches
This  view holds that these aren't just seven letters to Churches that we take advice on but each of the Seven Churches provide for us a prophetic snapshot of the Church Age - From its birth in the book of Acts up to the return of Christ.
They are both at the same time!

AD 30-100 (Ephesus) - Apostolic Church (The Church began)
AD 100-313 (Smyrna) - Persecuted Church (The body of Christ was Persecuted                                       everywhere)
AD 313-590 (Pergamum) - State Church (The emperor became Christian)
AD 590-1517 (Thyatira) - Papal Church (The Roman Catholic Church ruled and rained                                    with the pope in the dark ages and was doing lots of bad                                    things)
AD 1517-1730 (Sardis) - Reformed Church (Martin Luther gets saved and goes against                                the Roman Catholic Church and nailed his ideas on the                                        wittenberg door which reforms the church)
AD 1730-1900 (Philadelphia) - Missionary Church (Travel becomes a lot easier and the                                      gospel exploded around the world with missionaries)
AD 1900-Present (Laodicea) - Apostate Church

## The Loveless Church / Ephesus
>' “To the angel of the church in Ephesus write: ‘The words of him who holds the seven stars in his right hand, who walks among the seven golden lampstands.'
==Revelation 2:1==
https://www.bible.com/bible/59/REV.2.1
- The word angel translated from the word 'Aggelos' in Greek usually means Angel but it can be translated as a human messenger used by God.
- Some think this might be a pastor of this church
- Stars is the Angels and lampstands is the churches


>' “‘I know your works, your toil and your patient endurance, and how you cannot bear with those who are evil, but have tested those who call themselves apostles and are not, and found them to be false.'
==Revelation 2:2==
https://www.bible.com/bible/59/REV.2.2
>'I know you are enduring patiently and bearing up for my name’s sake, and you have not grown weary. '
==Revelation 2:3==
https://www.bible.com/bible/59/REV.2.3
- God remembers everything you do, He does not forget
- He knows our suffering (patient endurance)
- He sees the people who are teaching false doctrine and He sees us standing against them
- Ephesus were intolerant of evil people, now they were not mean or cruel to everyone but it means in the church they refused to tolerate people who were going against the church and stopping the church.
- We must judge people inside the church not outside the church, it is not our job to judge outside the church that is Gods job,==(1 Corinthians 5:12-13)== now this is not going round and judging everyone but it means judging people who are infiltrating the church and teaching wrong things ==(2 Corinthians 11:13)==

>'But I have this against you, that you have abandoned the love you had at first. '
==Revelation 2:4==
https://www.bible.com/bible/59/REV.2.4
- Ephesus were doing so much, they were going for the false prophets and only wanting the truth to come out which is all the right things to do. They would look good from the outside but on the inside they were missing their first love. They weren't loving God and loving one another. They were so focussed of the goal and forgot the why. 
- ==(1 Corinthians 13:3)== You can be doing everything right but if you don't do it with love, it means nothing.
- How are you doing at loving God? stop looking at others, look at yourself.
- Ephesus were too focused on others they forgot about looking at themselves

>'Remember therefore from where you have fallen; repent, and do the works you did at first. If not, I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place, unless you repent. '
==Revelation 2:5==
https://www.bible.com/bible/59/REV.2.5
- He is telling them repent, which means turn around, He is telling them to change course because if there is no love, He will make the church cease to excise
- You can see that that has happened today. In turkey the Christian population is tiny showing He most likely took the lampstand (Church) from its place and left it as they didn't turn from their hardened hearts.

>'Yet this you have: you hate the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate. '
==Revelation 2:6==
https://www.bible.com/bible/59/REV.2.6
- the Nicolaitans were most likely a group of people who were false prophets.


>'He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To the one who conquers I will grant to eat of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God.’ 
==Revelation 2:7==
https://www.bible.com/bible/59/REV.2.7
- You get the ear to hear from the Spirit
- a Conquer is someone who's faith has enabled them to overcome the world ==(1 John 5:4)==
- (==Genesis Chapter 3:22-24 The tree of life==) The tree of life gives you life forever. It is different from the tree they ate from (The Tree of knowledge of good and evil).
- Why did God not want Adam and eve to eat from the tree of life? its because they were sinners and in order for them to be redeemed they must first die. God kept us away from the tree of life all those years as actually an act of mercy because without death there cannot be life as we are sinners and we must first die to be redeemed. But the problem was that the death that we deserve ==(Wages of sin is death)== wouldn't allow us to enjoy anything after we die because that death means eternal separation from God so by Jesus dyeing he bore that separation and we are now able to eat from the tree of life as we will cast off our sinful nature when we physically die, we will them be ready to eat from the tree of life and live forever. ==(Revelation 22:1-2)==

# Bible Study - Revelation

Revelation is the word for apocalypse in Greek
Revelations means revealed or revealing

## Who is John?
The author of the Book of Revelation is traditionally identified as ==John of Patmos, also known as John the Revelator==. While the book itself simply identifies him as "John", early church tradition and some modern scholars equate him with the Apostle John, one of Jesus' twelve disciples. However, other scholars suggest that John of Patmos was a separate individual, possibly a Christian prophet. 

Here's a more detailed explanation:

- **Traditional view:**
    
    The early church, including figures like Irenaeus, identified the author of Revelation with John the Apostle. 
    
- **Modern scholarship:**
    
    Some modern scholars propose that John of Patmos was a distinct figure from the Apostle John, possibly a prophet within the Johannine community. 
    

- **Internal evidence:**
    
    Revelation 1:9 mentions that John was on the island of Patmos when he received his visions, and he is identified as a prophet. 
    

- **External evidence:**
    
    Early church writings, such as those of Irenaeus, link John of Patmos to the Apostle John. 
    

- **Debate:**
    
    There's ongoing debate among scholars about whether the author was the Apostle John, another John, or a combination of traditions.

## What are the rules for the interpretation?
1. The Plain Sense Rule
When the plain sense of Scripture makes common sense, seek no other sense.

2. The Law of Double Reference
The law of Double Reference is the tendency of Scripture prophecy to sometimes refer to two events or people simultaneously - one relevant to the general time of the prophecy and the other relating to the distant, far-off future
A single prophecy can be talking about two different events, one at that time and one in the future.

3. The Law if Recurrence
something can be explained and described and then another scripture can go back and focus on a specific part of that story.
E.G. Genesis - God made all of the world and rested on the 7th day but He then goes back and focuses on Adam and even on the sixth day otherwise you would think that God made loads of people.

4. The Law of Context
The verse can only mean what it means in context, it cannot be pulled out of its original context.
The only exception for this is God and His being and He is always constant and is always relevant and in context.

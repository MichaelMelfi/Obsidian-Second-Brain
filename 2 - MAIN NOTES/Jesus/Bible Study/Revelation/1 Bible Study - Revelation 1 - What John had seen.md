##### What Did I Learn From This Teaching?:
God is so perfect in everything He is
Jesus is in the midst of us always even if we don't think it.


# Bible Study - Revelation 1

## Prologue

> *'The revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave him to show to his servants the things that must soon take place. He made it known by sending his angel to his servant John, '*
==Revelation 1:1==
https://www.bible.com/bible/59/REV.1.1
- If you are a Christian then this book is for you as God gave this revelation to show the Servants (US)
- Some translations have the word soon or shortly but this doesn't mean something that will happen soon or time wise close to us.
It is a Greek phrase that means WHEN it begins it will happen or playout quickly.

> 'who bore witness to the word of God and to the testimony of Jesus Christ, even to all that he saw. 
> ==Revelation 1:2==
https://www.bible.com/bible/59/REV.1.2

> 'Blessed is the one who reads aloud the words of this prophecy, and blessed are those who hear, and who keep what is written in it, for the time is near. '
==Revelation 1:3==
https://www.bible.com/bible/59/REV.1.3

## John Writes to the Seven Churches

> *'John to the seven churches that are in Asia: Grace to you and peace from him who is and who was and who is to come, and from the seven spirits who are before his throne, '*
==Revelation 1:4==
https://www.bible.com/bible/59/REV.1.4
Translations for Seven Spirits:
1. The NIV adds a footnote next to 'Spirits' and says a possible translation to 'The seven fold Spirit' talking about the seven characteristics of the Holy Spirit
2. This verse could just be just referencing the holy spirit and using the number seven as the number of perfection and completeness.

>'and from Jesus Christ the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of kings on earth. To him who loves us and has freed us from our sins by his blood '
==Revelation 1:5==
https://www.bible.com/bible/59/REV.1.5
- The First born from the dead is meaning the first person to die and raise again and to never have to die again.
E.G - Lazarus was resurrected but has to die again at the end of his life as he is human.
- Jesus Loves us - you MUST have a personal revelation of His love otherwise you will just see it as a week love.
The enemy is trying all he can to try and make you think Jesus doesn't love you.
- Jesus has saved us from the penalty of sin (We don't have to die for our sin)
- Jesus has saved us from the dominion of sin (We now have the freedom to live without sin)
Sin now does not have to dominate us. We now have everything we need for Godliness ad don't have to live with sin anymore.

>'and made us a kingdom, priests to his God and Father, to him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen. '
==Revelation 1:6==
https://www.bible.com/bible/59/REV.1.6
- God has given us a kingdom and a priestly role in that kingdom (The biblical definition, not like a catholic priest)
- Some translations say He has made us Kings and Priests to God.

>'Behold, he is coming with the clouds, and every eye will see him, even those who pierced him, and all tribes of the earth will wail on account of him. Even so. Amen. '
==Revelation 1:7==
https://www.bible.com/bible/59/REV.1.7
When is this talking about the Rapture or the second coming of Christ?
1.  In the rapture and the catching away of the church Jesus (1 Thessalonians 4)
Jesus doesn't come down to earth in this, we go and meet Him in the clouds
The word rapture actually comes from the words 'caught up' as he is catching up the church
2.  This is not talking about the rapture, this is talking about the second coming of Christ.
- Every eye will see Him (Matthew 24:26-27)
- Even those who pierce Him and all the tribes will wail
This talks about the tribe of Israel (Jews). 
They were the ones who crucified him and pierced Him and they will wail at the thought that they crucified their king (Zechariah 12:10)

>' “I am the Alpha and the Omega,” says the Lord God, “who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty.” '
==Revelation 1:8==
https://www.bible.com/bible/59/REV.1.8
- This is God talking now as He uses the same wording at the end of Revelation. 
This actually proves that Jesus is God as it is Jesus that says the same words at the end of Revelation (Revelation 22:12-13)

## The Vision

>'I, John, your brother and partner in the tribulation (Troubles) and the kingdom and the patient endurance that are in Jesus, was on the island called Patmos on account of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus. '
==Revelation 1:9==
https://www.bible.com/bible/59/REV.1.9
- Patmos is now a part of Turkey. in that time that island was used by the Romans to imprison enemies of the empire so this included Christians.
- The statement 'partner in tribulation and the kingdom and the patient endurance that are in Jesus' is actually the perfect description for a believer. We have to patiently endure this world until Jesus comes back while being in tribulation with Jesus.

>'I was in the Spirit on the Lord’s day, and I heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet '
==Revelation 1:10==
https://www.bible.com/bible/59/REV.1.10
- The Lords Day is not referring to Sunday like normal.
In the Greek it is actually an adjective not a noun. He is saying that he is in the spirit on the Lords Day just meaning a day he was engulfed with all the presence of the Lord in that specific day.

>'saying, *“Write what you see in a book and send it to the seven churches, to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Pergamum and to Thyatira and to Sardis and to Philadelphia and to Laodicea.” '*
==Revelation 1:11==
https://www.bible.com/bible/59/REV.1.11

>'Then I turned to see the voice that was speaking to me, and on turning I saw seven golden lampstands, '
==Revelation 1:12==
https://www.bible.com/bible/59/REV.1.12
- These represent the Seven Churches shows in verse 20
- He chose these churches as these represents time periods throughout the church age from the start (Acts) to the current age and it will continue until the Church is caught up in the rapture.

>'and in the midst of the lampstands one like a son of man, clothed with a long robe and with a golden sash around his chest. '
==Revelation 1:13==
https://www.bible.com/bible/59/REV.1.13
- It is saying that Jesus is in our midst always!
- The son of man clothed with a long robe with a golden sash around his chest means Jesus is a high priest (Leviticus 8:6-7). In the time of Aaron and Moses they used to have a sash but there would only be gold woven into it, This is saying Jesus wears one of pure gold showing his purity and perfectness.

>'The hairs of his head were white, like white wool, like snow. His eyes were like a flame of fire, '
==Revelation 1:14==
https://www.bible.com/bible/59/REV.1.14
>'his feet were like burnished bronze, refined in a furnace, and his voice was like the roar of many waters. '
==Revelation 1:15==
https://www.bible.com/bible/59/REV.1.15
- In Daniel 10:5-6 it shows the same description.
- When it says the sound of many waters, it is talking about a sound like a sound of rapids.

>'In his right hand he held seven stars, from his mouth came a sharp two-edged sword, and his face was like the sun shining in full strength. '
==Revelation 1:16==
https://www.bible.com/bible/59/REV.1.16
- The Seven starts are the seven Angels
The seven angels can also be translated as seven Messengers
- The sharp two edged sword is the description of the Word Of God in the old testament (Hebrews 4:12)
- His face shinning like the sun is how Matthew describes Jesus in the transfiguration (Matthew 17:2)

>' When I saw him, I fell at his feet as though dead. But he laid his right hand on me, saying, “Fear not, I am the first and the last, '
==Revelation 1:17==
https://www.bible.com/bible/59/REV.1.17
- This is similar to how David reacted when he say God and both were given strength.
You must lower yourself to be lifted up

>'and the living one. I died, and behold I am alive forevermore, and I have the keys of Death and Hades. '
==Revelation 1:18==
https://www.bible.com/bible/59/REV.1.18
- I am the living one is Jesus saying He is the giver of life, He is life in all its fullness.
- This isn't Jesus saying Death had a handle over Him but saying that He has overcome the death (John 10:17-18)
- Hades means the place of the dead
- We do not need to be worried to death because Jesus has the keys to death and the place of the dead. When we die we are walking through the door out of death which He will open for us and we will walk out.

>'Write therefore the things that you have seen, those that are and those that are to take place after this. '
==Revelation 1:19==
https://www.bible.com/bible/59/REV.1.19
- These are the three divisions of how I will split up the book of Revelation.

>'As for the mystery of the seven stars that you saw in my right hand, and the seven golden lampstands, the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven churches.'
==Revelation 1:20==
https://www.bible.com/bible/59/REV.1.20
- These are explained in [[2 Bible Study - Revelation 2 - The Seven Churches]]

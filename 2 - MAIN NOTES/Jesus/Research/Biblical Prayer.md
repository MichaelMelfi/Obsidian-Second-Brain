# Biblical Prayer

The word **euche** is an old Greek word that describes a wish, desire, prayer, or vow. It was originally used to depict a person who made some kind of vow to God because of some need or desire in his or her life.

In the Bible, prayer is ==a way to communicate with God, ask for help, and experience God's closeness==. It's a two-way relationship where people can talk to God and listen to him. 

What does prayer mean in the Bible?

- **Communication**: Prayer is a way to talk to God, confess sins, and ask for needs and desires. 
- **Fellowship**: Prayer is a way to have a loving relationship with God, the creator of the universe.
- **Growth**: Prayer is a way to grow in intimacy with God. 
- **Asking**: Prayer is asking God to do what he has promised to do. 

Examples of prayer in the Bible

- **The Lord's Prayer**
    
    Jesus taught his disciples how to pray in the Lord's Prayer, which asks God to build his kingdom, forgive sins, and sustain his people. 
    
- **Psalm 91:15**
    
    "He shall call upon me and I will answer him: I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him, and honor him". 
    
- **Matthew 7:7**
    
    "Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you". 
    

How to pray 

Prayer can be audible or silent, private or public, formal or informal. It should be offered in faith, in the name of Jesus, and through the power of the Holy Spirit.

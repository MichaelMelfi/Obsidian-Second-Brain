Jehovah Jireh - The Lord my Provider
Jehovah Shabaoth - The Lord my Host
This is a prayer of FAITH
==The Lord will provide everything I need for today.==

“Therefore I say to you, whatever things you ask when you pray, believe that you receive them, and you will have them.”
- During Exodus, when the Israelites finally got free of slavery, they then wondered the wilderness for 40 years and of course there is no food out in the wilderness. God then fed them manna (bread) and quail (birds) from the sky every single day until they reached the promise land.

- God will provide everything you need no matter your situation or circumstance and He will do it for as long as he needs to; but you must have FAITH!

- You are blessed so that Gods glory is shown through you, you must not love money as the love of money is the route of evil!

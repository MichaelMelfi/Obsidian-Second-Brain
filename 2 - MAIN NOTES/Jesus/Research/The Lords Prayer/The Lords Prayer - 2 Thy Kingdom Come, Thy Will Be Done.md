God come into my kingdom
Be done your will
- NOTHING but His KINGDOM will come and NOTHING but His WILL be done.
- It is Him being king and Him being over all in power and authority
- Today nothing but the kingdom of God will rule in  my life.
- God created you with a worrier spirit.
- Wresting means being in hand to hand combat.
- In the ancient days of Paul in the original olympic Greek games., if you lost a wrestling match they would gouge your eyes out meaning you would loose sight of your vision.
- We are wresting in prayer and do not loose sight of our vision.
- “We bind the principalities and powers”
- Fight the good fight of faith to keep the vision alive. The good fight is a fight that we ALWAYS win
- Jesus has already broken the power of the enemy, all we have to do is resist the devil and he will flee from us!
- “Shout unto the Lord with a sound of triumph”!!!
==Today Nothing will come into==:
- My life
- My families and friends life
- My churches life
- My towns and worlds life
**James‬ ‭3‬:‭4‬ ‭NLT‬‬**
“And a small rudder makes a huge ship turn wherever the pilot chooses to go, even though the winds are strong.”
- Sometimes your tongue is referred to as your rudder as YOU HAVE WHAT YOU SAY.
- Your tongue is the rudder of your life.
**Proverbs‬ ‭18‬:‭21‬ ‭NLT‬‬**
“The tongue can bring death or life; those who love to talk will reap the consequences.”
- So no matter what hits your ship, if you have your rudder pointed to the right direction then you will always make it to the end/ its port of call/ its intended destination.
- If you set your rudder onto Jesus and the calling on your life then it will bring into order things and situations that look like a crazy storm.
==Declare it over your life==
- Jesus you will be the king of my life now and forever more, no matter what is thrown at me, no matter the storm or giant that is put before me, I will keep my rudder and faith on you to bring me out.
==Then declare it over your family/friends==
- **Proverbs 22:6:**
"Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it”
- **Joshua 24:15:**
"But as for me and my household, we will serve the Lord”
==Then over your/the church==
**Matthew‬ ‭16‬:‭18‬ ‭NLT‬‬**
Upon this rock I will build my church, and all the powers of hell will not conquer it.”
**Colossians‬ ‭1‬:‭18‬ ‭NLT‬‬**
“Christ is also the head of the church, which is his body. He is the beginning, supreme over all who rise from the dead. So he is first in everything.”
- The north, south, east and west shall give up and give back what belongs to the church
- The church is a battle field
- There is not one scared person in His army.
==Then over your town and world==

**Colossians‬ ‭1‬:‭16‬ ‭NLT‬‬**
“for through him God created everything in the heavenly realms and on earth. He made the things we can see and the things we can’t see— such as thrones, kingdoms, rulers, and authorities in the unseen world. Everything was created through him and for him.”

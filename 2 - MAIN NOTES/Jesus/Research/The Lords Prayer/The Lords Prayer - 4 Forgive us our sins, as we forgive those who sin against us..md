**Acts 3:19 (NIV)** 
“Repent, then, and turn to God, so that your sins may be wiped out, that times of refreshing may come from the Lord.”
- Repentance is a gift that God has given to us and it should be JOYFUL; we are getting set free!
- Repentance isn’t just saying sorry for what you’ve done but repentance is turning around and trying our hardest to not do it again.
- One of the best ways of Joyful repentance is using the 4 Rs
1. ==REPENT for your sin==
Call it what it is. It is your sin. 
- It could be things like pride, rebellion, addictions 
- It could even be a feeling, like rejection, inferiority, shame, anger, unforgivness
2. ==RECEIVE God's forgiveness and cleansing.==
- Ask God to fill you anew with His Holy Spirit; to strengthen you in your thoughts, behavior, and emotions.
1. ==REBUKE the enemy's hold on you==
- The enemy has no hold on you because of this sin! You are free.
- Matthew 4:10 (NIV) Jesus said to him, "Away from me, Satan!"
4. ==REPLACE all lies with Gods truth==
- Quite bible verses or what Gods says about you.
- **Philippians 3:14** Whatever I have, wherever I am, I can make it through anything in the One who makes me who I am


**Luke 23:34**
Jesus said, “Father, forgive them, for they don’t know what they are doing.” And the soldiers gambled for his clothes by throwing dice.”
- You must forgive people the same way Jesus forgave you on the cross! He knew everything you were already going to do and still forgave you. 
- He forgave the people who were putting him on the cross, while they spat at him, while they whipped Him and while they killed him. Do not wait to forgive; forgive straight away so there is no hold on you!
- I will forgive them no matter if they are spitting on me, shouting at me, mistreating me, whipping me, lying about me setting me up to die and fail. I will show them the same grace you (Jesus) showed me.
- Thank you Lord you have forgiven me, the same way you have forgiven and treated me, I will treat everyone else.
- If you allow your offence to get the best of you without forgiving the person you will not reach what God has for you. You cannot lead people and be used to your full extent if you are still hanging onto things that are behind you as they are keeping you attached to your last season.

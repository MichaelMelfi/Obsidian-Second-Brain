# Tape - Kenneth Copeland - Faith Of The Beliver
God uses faith just like we do, so anything God can do we can in faith!!!!!

God used faith to create the world

This is why if you tell a mountain to move with faith it will move as it was originally made by faith. So you’re telling it to edit itself with the same tool it was created with.

  

The devil was created by Gods faith so satan must conform to anything faith is or anywhere faith is put forward.

  

It is easier for heaven and earth to cease to exist than one of Gods punctuations in a sentence to be wrong!!

  

Abram to God was what Adam was to Satan as they both made deals with their words.

  

Word are so powerful that by saying just 7 words you can be saved from hell. The power of life and death are in the tongue

  

The power or God is the Holy Spirit. 

  

Words are containers:

There are empty words but also words that carry things

E.G your hand is a carrier/container of strength.

  

  

The best diet you can have it to not swallow anything. You can put whatever in your mouth and chew on it but not swallow it and you will not gain weight.

This is just like your spirit. You might be reading the bible, listening to preaches but not swallowing anything and putting anything into practice so you are not gaining spiritual weight and not growing your power of faith (just like muscles grow and you get stronger)

  

Sanctify means separate unto

  

We have the same responsibility as Jesus did.

“Just as he sent the son, he sends us”

  

No amount of drugs or alcohol can get you as happy and joyful than Gods spiritual high from reading the WORD OF GOD. 

Drinking and drugs are satans counterfeit worldly high for Gods spiritual high which you get from praying, worshiping etc. 

Because when you are in the word of God there is nothing better! people get healed, people get set free, families are put back together, you can beat down demons, step out of death and into new life. And that is a high that I will never come down from or ever want to come down from!!!!!!

  

“You will meet my needs according to his power and glory……”

I AM A TIETHER AND I HAVE A RIGHT TO THESE THINGS, SO MONEY IS NOT SOMETHING I WILL WORRY ABOUT”

  

Gods best for Simon wasn’t to only walk on the water but it was for him for cross the whole sea.

  

No matter what you mess up, God will be there to correct you. Whether that’s sinning or praying for healing.

  

The world has switched places between God and the devil. The world thinks God is making people sick and testing them they think that the devil out blessing people and making them rich and famous

“These signs will follow the believer not the unbeliever!”

“His word will not return void”

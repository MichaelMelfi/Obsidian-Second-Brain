# Tape - Larry Lea - The Lord's Prayer
Matthew 21:12

  

The four stages of what Jesus did and how it is working in our lives

  

House of purity

- Cleanses the temple/cleans the temple.

He has been shaking and changing us personally in our lives.

  

House of prayer

- Makes the temple the temple of prayer

He is making us a temple of prayer.

He went from place to place in prayer and did miracles in between.

  

House of power/healing

- The blind and the lame come to him

Because we pray we automatically become a house of power

  

House of perfected praise

- You can do all things

  

A trial is something that happens where there is no way out but by God

  

The boy in the tree that God asked to get out of the tree.

God is telling you to get out of your tree.

  

There are 3 levels of prayer

  

- Rising up early in the morning and pray till you know you have the power of God where you can go from one place of prayer to another place of prayer and work miracles.

  

  

1. A Desire to pray

  

- To want to pray, but struggle to or not knowhow to properly do it
- To be a desciple means to be dis

  

1. Discipline to pray

  

- to be able to pray no matter when things are good or bad
- Lifestyle of prayer
- To be able to rise early in the morning to be able to pray

  

  

  

- Simply a life that is given to prayer
- You prefer to pray than do anything else

  

When two people stand for something it WILL HAPPEN.

When it gets worse, you know it’s working because that is the devils last stance to stop it from working because he knows if two people agree then it is BOUND to happen.

  

You don’t read the bible the bible reads you.

It’s reads what kind of heart you have for God and finds out how much it can reveal to you.

He is called I AM because He will be whatever you need when you need it.

  

The Outline of Prayer

Matthew 6:9 the Lord’s Prayer 

Luke 11:1 when you pray SAY!!!

They both have the same outline of prayer!!!

|   |   |
|---|---|
|9 “In this manner, therefore, pray:<br><br>  <br><br>Our Father in heaven,<br><br>Hallowed be Your name.|Come into the prayer with praise|
|10 Your kingdom come.<br><br>Your will be done<br><br>On earth as it is in heaven.|Talk about the power or God and what you want the world to be like|
|11 Give us this day our daily bread.|Talk about prosperity every day, our DAILY BREAD not our weekly bread|
|12 And forgive us our debts,<br><br>As we forgive our debtors.|Repent for things that happened the day before and forgive everyone exactly how Jesus forgave you on the cross.|
|13 And do not lead us into temptation,<br><br>But deliver us from the evil one.|Talk about what you want to do today and the defeats of Satan.|
|For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen.|End with praise again|
|||

  

Hallowed be thy name

  

  

What to be thankful for - all of these are the Jehovah names

  

If you don’t get happy from praying you are not doing it right!

Praying should make you happyq

  

What we have from the blood of Jesus.

  

1. Your sins are forgiven through the blood

What would you do if Jesus came to you literally said to you that through my blood you are forgiven.

This is what PRAISE should be, the excitement you would get from that is what praise is.

  

1. You have the fullest of the spirit through the blood

Jehovah Shamma - the Lord is there

(Jehovah Shalom) - the Lord is peace

Jehovah Tsidkenu - the Lord is our righteousness

  

1. You have the soundness of the body through the blood (I am healed) 

(Jehovah Raffah) - the Lord is healing

- By his stripes I was healed

  

1. You have success/provider through the blood

(Jehovah Mekadishkem) - the Lord who sanctifies you 

Jehovah Jireh - the Lord my provider

  

1. You have security through the blood 

(Jehovah Nissy) - the Lord my banner 

Jehovah shamma - the Lord is there

  

  

  

PSALM 100:4

You get into the holiest of holys through thanks giving. It says you will enter BOLDLY into the holy of holys through the blood of Jesus.

  

You go in by the blood. You praise what the blood has done for you. Which is how you enter his courts with thanks giving and praise.

  

No matter what happens, you have nothing to do with a revive or bringing people to Christ. It’s because of prayer and being open to whatever God wants to do.

  

  

You meditate with the blood, you think about the blood and what the blood has done. 

It has given you peace, it has bought you joy and brought you out of depression.

  

Lift up your hands when you prayer.

  

One hand for no rath and the other hand for no doubt.

  

The blood was shed for me

Father, you are my father because of the blood

I’m a child of God because of the blood

Enter his gates with thanksgiving and praise

You are my righteousness (my sins being cleansed) (being in a relationship with God and Jesus)

You are my sanctification

The one who forgives me of my sins

The one who took my sin to the cross

You are my fullness

DO NOT TAKE YOUR EYES OFF THE BLOOD that set you free.

You are the lord my healer my health

Taken all sickness all pain

We are redeemed by the curse of the lord

I will succeed by the blood in anything I touch or do.

Taken all guilt and inferiority

I AM FORGIVEN

You are redeemed

  

Welcome in the Holy Spirit.

God Give revelation to their minds in this congregation.

  

IT SHALL BE DONE

  

  

  

  

Thy kingdom come 

thy will be done

God come into my kingdom

Be done your will

  

  

This is where a man puts his foot down.

Nothing but His kingdom will come and nothing but His will be done

  

It’s just Him being king and him being over all.

  

Today nothing but the kingdom of God will rule my life.

Nothing will come into my life

My families life

My friend life

My churches life

My Townes life

My worlds life

  

  

James 3:4

“Look also at ships: although they are so large and are driven by fierce winds, they are turned by a very small rudder wherever the pilot desires.”

‭

No matter what hits your ship, if you have your rudder right then you will always make it to the end/ its port of call/ its intended destination.

  

  

If you set your rudder onto the main things in your life then it will bring into order things that look like a crazy storm.

  

  

Do it in this order

  

  

Your life

Jesus you will be the king of my life now and forever more, no matter what is thrown at me, no matter the storm or giant put before me, I will keep my rudder and faith on you to bring me out.

  

Then declare it over your family

Children will be brought up the way they should go.

  

  

  

  

Then over your church

The north, south, east and west shall give up and give back what belongs to the church

  

Upon this rock I shall build my church

  

God created you with a worrier spirit.

The church is a battle field

There is not one scared person in His army.

We bind the principalities and powers.

Let the weak say I am strong!!

  

Wresting means being in hand to hand combat.

In the ancient days of Paul in the original olympics of the Greek games., if you lost a wrestling match they would gouge your eyes out meaning you would loose sight of your vision.

We are wresting in prayer and do not loose sight of our vision.

  

Fight the good fight of faith to keep the vision alive. The good fight is a fight that we win

Jesus has already broken the power of the enemy, all we have to do is resist the devil and he will flee from us!

  

Shout unto the Lord with a sound of triumph

  

  

Give us this day our daily bread

He shall receive 100 fold now in his time with persecution. 

This is because he shall become so prosperous that people will think he has to be doing something wrong to make that much money!

  

Whatever a man shall sow he shall also reap.

  

God shall supply all my needs according to His riches and glory.

  

Prosper means to have an abundance

  

You must be in the will of God

You cannot pray this line unless you are in the will of God / Jesus is the king of your life.

  

Upon this rock I shall build my church

  

To be in the will of God you must be connected and serving in the church of God.

  

God loves a cheerful given.

This is someone who doesn’t look if they can afford it, they just give and are joyful while doing it.

  

You must believe what Jesus says, good things happen to those who believe. FAITH!

  

GODS WORD WORKS FOR ME

I KNOW I WILL REEP BECAUSE GODS WORD WORKS FOR ME

  

I must be specific in my asking.

  

Be tenacious, we must become worriers. The love of Money is the route of all evil, if you take out the route then you take out the fruit, so you will cut off the evil by taking out the love of money.

  

  




  

  

  

And do not lead us into temptation,

But deliver us from the evil one

  

This is where you declare you have the armour of God that nothing formed against us shall prosper

  

You are my refuge my fortress

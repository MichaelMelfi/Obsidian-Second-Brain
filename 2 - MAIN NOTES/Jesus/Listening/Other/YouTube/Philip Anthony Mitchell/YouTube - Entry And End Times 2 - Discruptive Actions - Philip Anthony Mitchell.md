##### What Did I Learn From This Teaching?:

- Jesus Turned the tables in the temple because the priests were fleecing Gods people.
- We must be disruptive to the works of the enemy!
- We must not stand and watch everything going away from Gods word (The body being disconnected from the head) But ACT on it.
- Whatever your you do your children will do. If you dont worship and pray at home. Your children wont worship and pray.
- Jesus breaks tradition for the lost and hurting
- Father let me lover the things you love and hate the things your hate.
- We cannot be disconnected from God, the body must be in constant connection with the head (The body and head of Christ)


# YouTube - Entry And End Times 2 - Discruptive Actions - Philip Anthony Mitchell


> “Then Jesus went into the temple of God and drove out all those who bought and sold in the temple, and overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who sold doves. And He said to them, “It is written, ‘My house shall be called a house of prayer,’ but you have made it a ‘den of thieves.’ ” Then the blind and the lame came to Him in the temple, and He healed them. But when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that He did, and the children crying out in the temple and saying, “Hosanna to the Son of David!” they were indignant and said to Him, “Do You hear what these are saying?” And Jesus said to them, “Yes. Have you never read, ‘Out of the mouth of babes and nursing infants You have perfected praise’?” Then He left them and went out of the city to Bethany, and He lodged there.”
‭‭==Matthew‬ ‭21‬:‭12‬-‭17‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==

### Dying request

Just like, if your father was dying and made you promise to do something for him. You would make sure you would do it.
Same with things that made him upset you would remember that and take it seriously
His last dying words would be so important to you.

This is the same as Jesus dying.
You must take his last words so serious.
### Overturning the tables in the temple.

> “Then Jesus went into the temple of God and drove out all those who bought and sold in the temple, and overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who sold doves.”
‭‭==Matthew‬ ‭21‬:‭12‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/mat.21.12.NKJV

Imagine if Jesus did this now!
Social media would get so angry.
Too many fools have an opinion because of what they see online.
If you read this text you would think Jesus went and started turning tables straight away.

> “And Jesus went into Jerusalem and into the temple. So when He had looked around at all things, as the hour was already late, He went out to Bethany with the twelve.”
‭‭==Mark‬ ‭11‬:‭11‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/mrk.11.11.NKJV

This shows he went to the temple (Sunday), checked it all and surveyed it then went back to Bethany then back to the temple THE NEXT DAY (Monday)
He went into the temple to see the spiritual state of the temple then went away and meditated
Jesus did not see the state of the temple and stay quiet but he acted on it after going to God and disrupted it.
This place was meant to be holy but is now a flee market.

This is happening through the feast of Passover.
During the feast of Passover all the Jewish families had to sacrifice a lamb.
If you had to sacrifice a lamb, you had to purchase a lamb from the temple to be sacrificed.
And since the temple did not take roman money which is what everyone had, they only took temple money so you would have to go to the money changes to get the currency to buy your lamb.
The priests/pastors of the day were responsible for it all.
They would hike up the prices and add interest to flees Gods people from their money.
This is like have a £2 bottle of water that you have to pour out before you go through security at an airport then when you get through security it will be £15 for a bottle of water. They can do it because they know they have got you, you have no other option than to be fleeced.
Then if anyone would come with their own animal to sacrifice, the temple would have inspectors to say if the animal was okay to sacrifice or not and if it isn’t they would have to buy from the temple another one.

THIS WAS THE PRIESTS THAT SET THIS UP
They wanted to stack their own pockets from Gods people.

### THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME HE HAD HAD TO DO THAT.

> “Now the Passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. And He found in the temple those who sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the money changers doing business. When He had made a whip of cords, He drove them all out of the temple, with the sheep and the oxen, and poured out the changers’ money and overturned the tables. And He said to those who sold doves, “Take these things away! Do not make My Father’s house a house of merchandise!” Then His disciples remembered that it was written, “Zeal for Your house has eaten Me up.” So the Jews answered and said to Him, “What sign do You show to us, since You do these things?” Jesus answered and said to them, “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.” Then the Jews said, “It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and will You raise it up in three days?” But He was speaking of the temple of His body. Therefore, when He had risen from the dead, His disciples remembered that He had said this to them; and they believed the Scripture and the word which Jesus had said.”
‭‭==John‬ ‭2‬:‭13‬-‭22‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/jhn.2.15-22.NKJV

Jesus beat them with cords!!!!!
Imagine if social media got ahold of that!

Jesus cleansed the temple at the start of the ministry and also at the end of His ministry.

When we see something wrong we must act on it!

How do you see drag queen pastors and it not break your heart!
How do you see the government changing marriage and it not break your heart!

Luke warm Christianity is now normal!

How are we the body of Christ and we are not angry at what God is angry at?
Because we do church disconnected from the head!

LORD LET ME LOVE WHAT YOU LOVE AND HATE WHAT YOU HATE, STARTING ITH ME FIRST.
STARTING WITH MY HEART, MY SIN, MY SHAME.

### House Of Prayer

> “And He said to them, “It is written, ‘My house shall be called a house of prayer,’ but you have made it a ‘den of thieves.’ ””
‭‭==Matthew‬ ‭21‬:‭13‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/mat.21.13.NKJV

1. Jesus’s source of frustration is because it is written, it is in the word of God.
He knows that it is disconnected from the word of God and disconnected from the head.

We should read and be angry with the wrongs.

1. My house should be a house of prayer (Isaiah 56)
2. You have made it a den of robbers (Jeremiah 7)
He is quoting the Word of God!
He is showing how far it has come from the word of God.

### Healings and Miracles

> “Then the blind and the lame came to Him in the temple, and He healed them.”
‭‭==Matthew‬ ‭21‬:‭14‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/mat.21.14.NKJV

Jesus break tradition.
The sick were not allowed to come into the temple in the first century.
Where Jesus is there is a purging of wrong things.

### Children

> “But when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that He did, and the children crying out in the temple and saying, “Hosanna to the Son of David!” they were indignant”
‭‭==Matthew‬ ‭21‬:‭15‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/mat.21.15.NKJV

Why are they angry?
Jesus saved the temple, did healings but the priests were angry…

Just before this we saw that the portents were shouting Hosanna to Jesus as he rode in on the donkey and now the children are shouting the same.
You children pick up on everything you do.
When you say something your children repeat it.
When you do something your children will do it to.
When you come to church and see you not worshipping or praying they wont either!
If you are not praying and worshipping at home they wont either!

Do not ask why your children are falling away when there is no presence of the Holy Spirit in your house!



> “and said to Him, “Do You hear what these are saying?” And Jesus said to them, “Yes. Have you never read, ‘Out of the mouth of babes and nursing infants You have perfected praise’?””
‭‭==Matthew‬ ‭21‬:‭16‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/mat.21.16.NKJV

Jesus is saying that even if the priests don't worship and praise him, the children the rocks and everything else will!

> “Then He left them and went out of the city to Bethany, and He lodged there.”
‭‭==Matthew‬ ‭21‬:‭17‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/mat.21.17.NKJV

WE MUST BE DISRUPTIVE AGAINST THE THINGS DISRUPTING THE CHURCH

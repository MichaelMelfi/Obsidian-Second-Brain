> “As Jesus and the disciples approached Jerusalem, they came to the town of Bethphage on the Mount of Olives. Jesus sent two of them on ahead. “Go into the village over there,” he said. “As soon as you enter it, you will see a donkey tied there, with its colt beside it. Untie them and bring them to me. If anyone asks what you are doing, just say, ‘The Lord needs them,’ and he will immediately let you take them.” This took place to fulfill the prophecy that said, “Tell the people of Jerusalem, ‘Look, your King is coming to you. He is humble, riding on a donkey— riding on a donkey’s colt.’” The two disciples did as Jesus commanded. They brought the donkey and the colt to him and threw their garments over the colt, and he sat on it. Most of the crowd spread their garments on the road ahead of him, and others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road. Jesus was in the center of the procession, and the people all around him were shouting, “Praise God for the Son of David! Blessings on the one who comes in the name of the Lord! Praise God in highest heaven!” The entire city of Jerusalem was in an uproar as he entered. “Who is this?” they asked. And the crowds replied, “It’s Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee.””
‭‭==Matthew‬ ‭21‬:‭1‬-‭11‬ ‭NLT‬‬==

This passage is during - AD 33 - Jerusalem
Month - Neeson which is April

This is during Passover where everyone would celebrate their deliverance from 400 years of Egyptian slavery.

##### Side note (About Passover):
When the slaves of Egypt were crying out to God and praying for a deliverer, God was talking to Moses, They were crying out and praying for help and God is talking to the answer.
Just because God is silent to you doesn’t mean He is not talking to your answer!

Then through Moses they get the word that God is going to send a death angel so they must slay a lamb and take the blood of the lamb and put the blood over the doorframe of their house.
So when the death angel came to the house it would see the blood of the lamb over it and would ’PASSOVER’ the house.
There were roughly 250,000 lamb slain that weekend which means about 2 million people were saved from the angel as it would be one family per lamb.
This is all symbolising the coming of Christ. As Jesus is the lamb of God to be slaughtered.
Jesus is on the doorframe of our lives!

This passage is the first significant event of what is called the passion week of Christ.

#### The Donkey, Why?
Matthew 21:1-3
> “Now when they drew near Jerusalem, and came to Bethphage, at the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples, saying to them, “Go into the village opposite you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied, and a colt with her. Loose them and bring them to Me. And if anyone says anything to you, you shall say, ‘The Lord has need of them,’ and immediately he will send them.””
‭‭==Matthew‬ ‭21‬:‭1‬-‭3‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/mat.21.1-3.NKJV

Worriers ride on horses but a donkey is a symbol of peace.
He wanted to show that he is not coming on a horse for battle but for peace.
HOWEVER, The next time he comes back riding in will be on the horse, the next time He comes He is coming to make war and not peace, make sure you are on the side of that war!!!!!!

They are on their way to Jerusalem and stop at a place called Bathphage and tells that Jesus is getting ready to enter the city for the very last time in His life.
Jesus specifically requests a donkey for Him to ride in on.
Why is this? Throughout Jesus’ ministry he has WALKED from Northern Israel all the way to the south of Jerusalem. Jesus walked 100 miles stopping every night for rest all the way to Jerusalem.

Bethphage is a suburb or Jerusalem, why stop there??

There is no record of Jesus riding an animal in the scriptures.
Why does he request a donkey after walking 100 miles just for the last mile??
He is not asking for the donkey because He is tired, or because he cannot walk the last mile.
He is requesting the donkey to perform a public display of Him riding a donkey into the city of Jerusalem.
Jesus throughout the scriptures tries NOT to draw attention to himself.
So why is He now trying to make a sceptical out of this and make sure people know He is riding in, is it because he wants likes on instagram??

#### Prophecies
Matthew 21:4-5
> “All this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying: 
> “Tell the daughter of Zion, ‘Behold, your King is coming to you, 
> Lowly, and sitting on a donkey, A colt, the foal of a donkey.’ ””
‭‭==Matthew‬ ‭21‬:‭4‬-‭5‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/mat.21.4-5.NKJV

He did it to fulfil a prophecy that was said 500 years before Jesus was ever born!

Jesus knowing biblical prophecy made sure the prophecy came to pass so that Gods word would not fall to the floor!

Daniel 9:24-27

Now not only did it fulfil that prophecy but also in Daniel 9
> ““Seventy weeks are determined For your people and for your holy city, To finish the transgression, To make an end of sins, To make reconciliation for iniquity, To bring in everlasting righteousness, To seal up vision and prophecy, And to anoint the Most Holy. “Know therefore and understand, That from the going forth of the command To restore and build Jerusalem Until Messiah the Prince, There shall be seven weeks and sixty-two weeks; The street shall be built again, and the wall, Even in troublesome times. “And after the sixty-two weeks Messiah shall be cut off, but not for Himself; And the people of the prince who is to come Shall destroy the city and the sanctuary. The end of it shall be with a flood, And till the end of the war desolations are determined. Then he shall confirm a covenant with many for one week; But in the middle of the week He shall bring an end to sacrifice and offering. And on the wing of abominations shall be one who makes desolate, Even until the consummation, which is determined, Is poured out on the desolate.””
‭‭==Daniel‬ ‭9‬:‭24‬-‭27‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/dan.9.24-27.NKJV

Someone studied these dates and times.
483 years From the time this was said, the math works out that ‘The Annointed one’ would ride into the city in the month of Neeson.
Now to the month and day this was written it is said that Jesus rode into Jerusolam 483 years on the donkey!

By doing this one thing, Jesus fulfils two major prophecies!

#### God Looks After His Word
Jesus made sure that the word of God stayed true!
You have other religious books that haven’t said anything about the future and the only one that has done this is the bible with 100s of them.
When God speaks, he watches his word to make sure it comes to pass.

This is a reminder that everything God has spoken over me WILL COME TO PASS.

So when He tells you that your name is written in the lambs book of life i dont have to be afraid of death because i have confidence in the word of God.

When you get a Remah word from a credible source, it doesn’t matter how long it takes to come to pass. As long as you are obidient and faithful, It will always come to pass and God will make sure of it!


#### Christ alines himself with the word and will of God
Make sure you are aligned with the word of God.
We must be wise that when we know the will of God we must aline with it.
It shows the power of what happens when you hear and submit to God.

#### Power of a simple instruction
It also shows the power of a simple instruction
> “His disciples did not understand these things at first; but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written about Him and that they had done these things to Him.”
==‭‭John‬ ‭12‬:‭16‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/jhn.12.16.NKJV

This passage shows that his disciples did not understand why they were getting the donkey.
But the Lord knew
So what happens if they said no to getting the donkey because they didn’t understand it?
Gods word would fall to the floor and the prophecies would not have been fulfilled.
You do not know the weight of one simple instruction, a simple instruction from God to you could fulfil a prophecy in someone else’s life! You have no idea what is on the other side of a simple action God has told you to do.
OBEY WHEN GOD SPEAKS

> “So the disciples went and did as Jesus commanded them.”
‭‭==Matthew‬ ‭21‬:‭6‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/mat.21.6.NKJV

Even though the disciples were confused they went and got the donkey in their confusion.

(The story of the DTS where the student did a head stand next to a tree which then got a man saved.)

I might not know why you are telling me to do this lord but i will obey.
You do not need all the answers to be obedient, you just need submission and faith.


#### Laying it all down

> “They brought the donkey and the colt, laid their clothes on them, and set Him on them. And a very great multitude spread their clothes on the road; others cut down branches from the trees and spread them on the road. Then the multitudes who went before and those who followed cried out, saying: “Hosanna to the Son of David! ‘Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!’ Hosanna in the highest!””
‭‭==Matthew‬ ‭21‬:‭7‬-‭9‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/mat.21.7-9.NKJV

2 things in these verse!
This is not 2025.
This is AD 33 in Israel.
The average person unless you were very rich only had ONE outer garment they owned.
Clothing was hard to come by, the average person did not have a closet full of clothes.
what they had on their backs was all that they owned.
But when these people saw the Christ they take the most valuable thing they have and they throw it down on the floor.
They are saying that Christ is so worthy that there is nothing i will withhold or keep from him.
And because it is so crowded, they dont even know if they are going to get it back!

Hosanna means - God save is now from psalm 1:18

When the people saw Jesus they aren’t asking for things and physical stuff from him but asking for Something far more valuable, salvation!
God give me wisdom, God give me revelation, God give me peace, God save me!

#### Do not live of peoples praises
What’s crazy is just 3 days later, another crowed was saying crucify Him.
This is why it is so important to not live in the praises of people.
The same people who love you one week might hate you the next week.
If you have to find your affirmation from the praises of people you will be weak because you will die by their rejection.
Our only affirmation is from the Lord otherwise you are in trouble.



> “And when He had come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved, saying, “Who is this?” So the multitudes said, “This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth of Galilee.””
‭‭==Matthew‬ ‭21‬:‭10‬-‭11‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/mat.21.10-11.NKJV

This is what we need in the world!
For peoples hearts to be moved, stired when they feel the power of God near them!

We need an awaking of people who know that Christ is coming soon and are moved with passion for people to come to the right side of this battle.

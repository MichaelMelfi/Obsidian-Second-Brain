# YouTube - Jerry Savell - This Is Your Defining Moment

#### Defining moment means:
1. A point at which a essential character of a person is established
2. A signature move, it expresses a persons true identity
3. A repeated action that has your name all over it
Defining moment change, move and effect our lives.
It’s not what happens in our lives that define us but our reaction to those things

#### Some defining moments in my life
- Accepting the lord into my life and being baptised
- Breaking my addiction by going to Scotland with my mum.
- Leaving London and my work and family and going to Cambodia for my 6 months training and mission trip.
- Breaking up with Ella.
- Loosing my first job at Foxtons.
- Getting the revelation of healing and the power of the Holy Spirit then a couple of days later becoming very sick and covered with red spots and then Healing myself of the spots and disease by the next morning.
- 

Do you remember the first time you had revelation knowledge?
- The revelation of healing and the holy spirit
- Faith, is what God used to make the world so we can edit the world.

God told Isaac in Genesis to stay in the land that he had given him and he will bless him.
There was a famine in the land and Isaac still decided to sow in the land.
In the natural that would have been the stupidest thing because he wouldn’t be able to water it or grow it.
God said do not go to Egypt. Why?. Because God didn’t want there to be another source, He wanted to be Isaac only source.
With God you will prosper where ever you are.
Isaac sowed the seed in the famine land and the bible says he reaped 100 fold in the same year.
It goes onto say ‘he waxed great’

### BIBLICAL DEFINING MOMENTS
1. When Moses talked to the burning bush (Exodus 3)
- God then told him what to do. If Moses had talked himself out of what God was telling him to do then he would have missed the defining moment in his life
2. Daniel in the lions den
- He would not cave into the pressure.
3. Shadrack, Meshak and abednigo
- When they stood up to Nebecaneza and said they would not burn and they did not burn in the fire. And the fire even burned the people around it but not them.

Once you’ve had a defining moment you are never the same.

#### A man who missed his defining moment

> “As Jesus was starting out on his way to Jerusalem, a man came running up to him, knelt down, and asked, “Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?” “Why do you call me good?” Jesus asked. “Only God is truly good. But to answer your question, you know the commandments: ‘You must not murder. You must not commit adultery. You must not steal. You must not testify falsely. You must not cheat anyone. Honor your father and mother.’” “Teacher,” the man replied, “I’ve obeyed all these commandments since I was young.” Looking at the man, Jesus felt genuine love for him. “There is still one thing you haven’t done,” he told him. “Go and sell all your possessions and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.” At this the man’s face fell, and he went away sad, for he had many possessions.”
‭‭==Mark‬ ‭10‬:‭17‬-‭22‬ ‭NLT‬‬==

He was told to give everything up and follow Jesus but he did not do that and missed his defining moment
The rich man didn’t have possessions, the possessions had him.

You must be ready to give your best, if you struggle to give your best away then you do not have that possession… that possession has you.

When God asks you to give something, he is setting you up for a greater blessing.

It’s the reaction to the defining moment that changes your life.

Do not stop sowing.
If you stop sowing you are cutting yourself off from God the provider.

God says He will be your source.
He will empower us to prosper.
In Genesis 12 God says obey me and He will be Abrahams source and provider.
Abraham obeyed God and JUST 1 CHAPTER LATER in Genesis 13 it says that Abraham was rich is cattle, gold and silver.
##### ==How many chapters will it take you?==

Then later when army’s came for Abraham, all Abraham had was 300 house hold servants yet won against all of the army’s and kings and sook their spoils but the first thing Abraham did was sow and tithe to melkizadeck. He honoured the God that made him rich.

> “Abraham was now a very old man, and the Lord had blessed him in every way.”
‭‭==Genesis‬ ‭24‬:‭1‬ ‭NLT‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/116/gen.24.1.NLT

Do not ever stop sowing.

> “Give freely and become more wealthy; 
> be stingy and lose everything. 
> The generous will prosper; 
> those who refresh others will themselves be refreshed. 
> People curse those who hoard their grain, 
> but they bless the one who sells in time of need. 
> If you search for good, you will find favor; 
> but if you search for evil, 
> it will find you! 
> Trust in your money and down you go! 
> But the godly flourish like leaves in spring. 
> Those who bring trouble on their families inherit the wind. 
> The fool will be a servant to the wise. 
> The seeds of good deeds become a tree of life; 
> a wise person wins friends. 
> If the righteous are rewarded here on earth, 
> what will happen to wicked sinners?”

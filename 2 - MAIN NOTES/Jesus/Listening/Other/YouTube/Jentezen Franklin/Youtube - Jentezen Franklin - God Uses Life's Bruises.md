##### What Did I Learn From This Teaching?:


# Youtube - Jentezen Franklin - God Uses Life's Bruises


>'And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said to his fellow at the command of the Lord , “Strike me, please.” But the man refused to strike him. Then he said to him, “Because you have not obeyed the voice of the Lord , behold, as soon as you have gone from me, a lion shall strike you down.” And as soon as he had departed from him, a lion met him and struck him down. Then he found another man and said, “Strike me, please.” And the man struck him—struck him and wounded him. So the prophet departed and waited for the king by the way, disguising himself with a bandage over his eyes. And as the king passed, he cried to the king and said, “Your servant went out into the midst of the battle, and behold, a soldier turned and brought a man to me and said, ‘Guard this man; if by any means he is missing, your life shall be for his life, or else you shall pay a talent of silver.’ And as your servant was busy here and there, he was gone.” The king of Israel said to him, “So shall your judgment be; you yourself have decided it.” Then he hurried to take the bandage away from his eyes, and the king of Israel recognized him as one of the prophets. And he said to him, “Thus says the Lord , ‘Because you have let go out of your hand the man whom I had devoted to destruction, therefore your life shall be for his life, and your people for his people.’” And the king of Israel went to his house vexed and sullen and came to Samaria.'

God can easily chose someone else to do a job if you disobey him
He can always replace you.
Be happy when God says something and do what He says.
The very thing that the world hurts you with, God will use to help other people.

Some people who have a lot of scars and bruises think they then cant do the will of God but this is so untrue. 
It is your wounds that will get you in the presence of the King.
A lot of people quit when it gets tough but that is exactly what builds you up as God is getting your ready.
Gods using what your going through to prepare you.
There are somethings that you will never get over but you will get through it.

The king only listened to him because he had gone through something.

If God loves you, you will go through things because He wants you to grow.

Sometimes God puts you in a role of leadership and you are worried because you are wounded so don't think you can do anything but everyone is wounded and those people will see you wounded and see you have experience.
You cant get out of your wounds by looking at them.
He has qualified you to lead, show your wounds to everyone!

You don't get to pick the wounds life gives you, but you do get to pick your attitude about it.
He didn't say you wouldn't have weapons formed against you but that they wouldn't prosper.

1 Chronicles 2:16
David's sister - Zara (means 'my wounds') had 3 sons
She had visible wounds from something that happened in childhood.

These three names were 
Abishai - killed another giant
Joab - 4 star general
Asahel - The fastest man in Israel

# YouTube - Myles Munroe - How To Strengthen Your Faith (Expecting The Unexpected)

1. **There are questions in life we cannot answer so do not make up answers.**
- Do not speak about things you do not know about

2. **There are things that you cannot explain**
- Do not try and impress people by make up answers about the histories of life

3. **There are things in life you can never change**
- We can pray and fast as much as we want but some things you cannot change.
- Know your limits

4. **There are things in life you cannot control**

5. **There are things in life you cannot stop**
- Death, we can’t stop or change when it happens

6. **There are things in life we cannot be responsible for**
- Sometimes we try and take responsibility for everything and it kills us.
- E.G. your kids life styles once they turn an adult.
- You cannot sit depressed if someone divorces you.
- You are not responsible if your spouse dies.

7. **There are things in life we cannot exceed**
- We might spend all the money we have to make someone medically well and it still didn’t work. You cannot exceed it.
- You do the most you can then trust God with the rest

#### ‘Expect the best and prepare for the worst. Do all that YOU can and leave the rest to God.’

Let God Be God
Some of us try and be God.
We try to explain everything, we just always have a prophecy we always know an answer.
Sometimes we have to say I DON‘T KNOW because your answer can be detrimental to that person.

There are things only God can do so behave yourself.
There are things only Gods knows so shut yourself up.
There are things only God understands so don’t try to understand everything.
There are things only God can explain so let Him explain it and He will tell you if He wants to and if He doesn’t then that is okay.

Know what you know and thank God for what you know.

##### KNOW YOUR LIMIT so enjoy yourself and LET GOD BE GOD.

Some people die And when it comes to the funeral, They know who they are and what chair they sat in but no one knows that person personally because they have not served and been apart of the church or body.

You are not remembered for the things you did not do.

Even David knew his limits.
> “Lord, my heart is not haughty, Nor my eyes lofty. Neither do I concern myself with great matters, Nor with things too profound for me.”
‭‭==Psalms‬ ‭131‬:‭1‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/psa.131.1.NKJV

> “Lord, my heart is not proud; my eyes are not haughty. I don’t concern myself with matters too great or too awesome for me to grasp.”
‭‭==Psalms‬ ‭131‬:‭1‬ ‭NLT‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/116/psa.131.1.NLT

1. **Every problem is temporary**

2. **Never apply a permanent solution to a temporary problem**
- Sometimes we make a permanent decision because of pressure not because of purpose.

3. **The most dangerous thing to loose in life is your faith**
- When faith is lost, life has nothing left.
- When you loose your faith you loose everything
 Judas and Peter both had the same problem, they both denied Jesus and one got paid for it.
 BOTH OF THEM COULD HAVE BEEN SAVED
 You can ALWAYS be forgiven.
 But because Judas thought he couldn’t be forgiven and lost his FAITH and applied the permanent solution of killing himself to the temporary situation of forgiveness.
 
> “Then Judas threw the silver coins down in the Temple and went out and hanged himself. The leading priests picked up the coins. “It wouldn’t be right to put this money in the Temple treasury,” they said, “since it was payment for murder.””
‭‭==Matthew‬ ‭27‬:‭5‬-‭6‬ ‭NLT‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/116/mat.27.5-6.NLT

I do not trust anyone because no one is permanent, everyone and everything is temporary.

I love everyone but i have to imagine life as if they weren’t there because anything can happen.

Myles’s wife is still alive, however, Myles has gone through his wife’s funeral in his head, he has gone through the emotions and actually imagined her being in the casket multiple times just so when it actually happens it will not impact him.

Change is the only thing we are promised, so be ready for it.

Jesus said expect the worst so you will not be offended in Me

> “Jesus asked, “Do you finally believe? But the time is coming—indeed it’s here now—when you will be scattered, each one going his own way, leaving me alone. Yet I am not alone because the Father is with me. I have told you all this so that you may have peace in me. Here on earth you will have many trials and sorrows. But take heart, because I have overcome the world.””
==‭‭John‬ ‭16‬:‭31‬-‭33‬ ‭NLT‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/116/jhn.16.32.NLT


Everything has a season.
People will be there for a season
Things will be there for a season
You cannot stop life because there is a hard season.
You must outlast your season. That is how you win at life
When summer finishes and it gets to winter, you do not throw out all of your summer clothes. No, you keep them because you know the season will go back at some point.

> “For everything there is a season, a time for every activity under heaven.”
‭‭==Ecclesiastes‬ ‭3‬:‭1‬ ‭NLT‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/116/ecc.3.1.NLT

You must forget to move forward.
The best days are ahead.
> “I don’t mean to say that I have already achieved these things or that I have already reached perfection. But I press on to possess that perfection for which Christ Jesus first possessed me. No, dear brothers and sisters, I have not achieved it, but I focus on this one thing: Forgetting the past and looking forward to what lies ahead,”
‭‭==Philippians‬ ‭3‬:‭12‬-‭13‬ ‭NLT‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/116/php.3.12-13.NLT

We are so tied to permanence that we can’t enjoy change.
Some people haven’t chosen the promotion or pushed for the promotion because they are so competent in what they already have.

If you are going through a tough time, it is because there is a change coming for you to go to the next level.

Faith doesn’t quit.
Mature people don’t panic, they plan.

Maturity is levelled on how well you accept change.
- as a church
- Family
- Friendship

How you handle change exposes how you really are.

1. The key to effective living Is the capacity and ability to manage the unexpected and also the expected
2. Success is measured by your ability to maintain personal balance in time of turmoil
3. Maturity is measured by your capacity to respond effectively to tragedy and chaos.

The faith we have in the Kingdom of God is the balance.
The greatest challenge in life is to our faith

#### You cannot believe something until you doubt it first.
This is why your son or daughter have to challenge the faith you gave them because that is not their own faith that is your faith, they have to find their own faith.

Nothing is yours until you understand it.

I can give you my information but it is not yours, you do not own it yet, it becomes your when you get to test it yourself

Great Faith is built on doubt first.
If there is no doubt you cannot have full faith because you have not tested it.

That is why Satan comes to test/attack your belief system to see if you actually believe what you’ve been saying.

The greatest test to your faith is unexplained tragedy because even though you do not know what’s happened you have to still believe through the odds.
Like Job in the Bible, everything was against him, however, he still believed.
There is no evidence except for the Word of God

#### LIFE OF JOB
The devil came to God to test Job.
The devil said that Job only liked God because of everything he had and the success he had.
BUT God said ‘I know my servant Job’ God knew that through everything Job would not turn away from Him.
Can you say that about yourself?
If the Devil came to God and said that about you, would God be able to turn around and say ‘I know my servant Michael?’

What ever you have, God gave it to you anyway.
If the devil took anything, God allowed it.
Whatever you loose God can give you 7 times what you ever had!

At the end of the Book of Job, Job says to his friends who were arguing and belittling him the whole time ‘you are ignorant’ ‘Do you think i serve God for something?’ ‘Because even though yet he has sleighed me yet will i trust in him’

Then after all of this God have Job 7 times more than he ever had.

Endurance means there might be 2 mins left in the game but you keep going 100%
THE GAME IS NOT OVER YET

There are people depending on you, you cannot give up.

You must play through the pain.
The shot that you shoot through the pain (when you are injured) that can win you the football game.

The Devil is not your problem, it is your faith that the devil is after.
Once you loose you faith the devil wins.
As long as you can say I’m still playing even though I’m injured, we win!

# YouTube - Myles Munroe - Being Baptised In The Holy Spirit
The Holy Spirit is the energy of the Church

  

The Holy Spirit is the person of God is what causes Gods word to come to pass

  

Spiritual power is for everyone, it’s a privilege of every believer.

  

Even thought the Holy Spirit is the most unknown out of the trinity He is the most important one for believers.

  

“And then he told them, “Go into all the world and preach the Good News to everyone. Anyone who believes and is baptized will be saved. But anyone who refuses to believe will be condemned. These miraculous signs will accompany those who believe: They will cast out demons in my name, and they will speak in new languages. They will be able to handle snakes with safety, and if they drink anything poisonous, it won’t hurt them. They will be able to place their hands on the sick, and they will be healed.””

‭‭Mark‬ ‭16‬:‭15‬-‭18‬ ‭NLT‬‬

  

Jesus left us with the responsibility of salvation.

He placed this into our hands once Jesus resurrected.

But also that we shall heal the sick and pray in new tongues.

We are ambassadors of Christ

  

  

Acts 1 this is a couple of days after the mark verse.

  

“And being assembled together with them, He commanded them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the Promise of the Father, “which,” He said, “you have heard from Me;”

‭‭Acts‬ ‭1‬:‭4‬ ‭NKJV‬‬

  

Imagine how difficult it would be for the disciples to wait.

They knew how to preach and they knew all the knowledge as they had lived with Jesus the past 3 years. But they did not have the power yet so told them to wait.

  

You might be excited to heal the sick etc but you must wait as excitement won’t heal the sick, you must wait for the revelation.

  

  

“for John truly baptized with water, but you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now.” Therefore, when they had come together, they asked Him, saying, “Lord, will You at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?” And He said to them, “It is not for you to know times or seasons which the Father has put in His own authority. But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be witnesses to Me in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth.””

‭‭Acts‬ ‭1‬:‭5‬-‭8‬ ‭NKJV‬‬

  

Even John had all the knowledge but no power.

  

Education does not confirm demonstration.

  

One is water baptism and one is Holy Spirit.

They are different.

  

Jesus was saying don’t move because what is going to come is power.

Jesus knew when he would leave there would be a power gap as the Holy Spirit was in Jesus and non of the disciples were not baptised in the Holy Spirit.

  

When Jesus went up so did the Holy Spirit he said WAIT you must wait for the power to come back to earth.

  

“But as many as received Him (Jesus), to them He gave the right to become children of God, to those who believe in His name:”

‭‭John‬ ‭1‬:‭12‬ ‭NKJV‬‬

  

In Greek:

  

The power they are talking about in John is authority. 

(A legal right)

  

The power spoken about in acts is talking about an explosion/explosive power.

The Greek word (Dunimis)

(This is to Back up the legal right/authority from John)

  

  

  

“Then, the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and said to them, “Peace be with you.” When He had said this, He showed them His hands and His side. Then the disciples were glad when they saw the Lord. So Jesus said to them again, “Peace to you! As the Father has sent Me, I also send you.” And when He had said this, He breathed on them, and said to them, “Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained.””

‭‭John‬ ‭20‬:‭19‬-‭23‬ ‭NKJV‬‬

  

This is where the disciples became saved.

Before this they were followers/students.

  

When the Lord made us in Genesis 2 He breathed into us just like the disciples for breathed on in John.

We were made to have the Holy Spirit from the start! But because of Adam’s fall the Holy Spirit left us.

  

John is where they became saved but Acts was where they received the power!

  

Going out and talking about Jesus is not the big deal!

  

“But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be witnesses to Me in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth.””

‭‭Acts‬ ‭1‬:‭8‬ ‭NKJV‬‬

  

He didn’t say we will GO and witness but here it is saying we will BE the witness.

  

it is good talking about the good news but we must BE the witness and act the good news.

  

When we speak to people they should say to us that it’s like we actually personally live with Jesus and we say yes he lives in me and he can live in you too!

  

When someone says where is Jesus?

You should be able to go to a sick person and heal them and show them that Jesus is right here.

  

It is like the disciples were walking around as a cup and once they did something they would be drained and have to get refilled by Jesus the well.

Once they had been baptised by the Holy Spirit they then themselves became the well!

  

Entering into the Holy Spirit is imperative.

In mark it says that every believer must be baptised and then the signs will follow.

  

Some have been baptised in the Holy Spirit and don’t know it!

Understanding the Holy Spirit is the secret to everything.

  

If you want to understand something you must start from the beginning, people try and start in the middle of the ocean and give up because it’s too hard and too deep.

  

In Corinthians it says they have zeal without knowledge. They have the power but don’t understand it.

  

Once you understand you must look for the devil. Look for the sick

Look for the troubled

Look for the hurting

You cannot say Church was good when people who came sick left sick!!!

  

We must teach each other!

One can put a thousand to flight but 2 can put ten thousand to flight.

At the moment we have 1000 who cannot put anything to flight as the body of Christ doesn’t understand its power!

  

The Holy Spirit isn’t there to make you feel good but to sort troubles out!

  

Charismatic comes from the word charisma 

This means someone who has outstanding talents or gift or a magnetic personality

  

This means everyone who is saved is charismatic because everyone has gifts from God.

  

  

“In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. The earth was without form, and void; and darkness was on the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters.”

‭‭Genesis‬ ‭1‬:‭1‬-‭2‬ ‭NKJV‬‬

  

The Holy Spirit was there right from the beginning.

The first thing to move to start everything was the Holy Spirit. 

  

The Holy Spirit was waiting for God to say let there be light before he could move. But He was there the whole time

  

“Then God said, “Let there be light”; and there was light.”

‭‭Genesis‬ ‭1‬:‭3‬ ‭NKJV‬‬

  

It’s the Holy Spirit creating the light but He has to wait for the word (Jesus) that comes from GOD (the head of the God head) before He can do anything.

  

  

Explaining the God Head.

When you want to get up and walk outside you have to decide to walk outside then your mind has to trigger with your muscles to get up then your muscles have to agree with your mind.

  

The initial thought is GOD

The decision/word is JESUS

The action is the HOLY SPIRIT

  

We are one person but everything we do has three actions yet we are one person. This is the same as the God Head. He is one God but 3 actions

  

“Then God said, “Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, and over the cattle, over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.””

‭‭Genesis‬ ‭1‬:‭26‬ ‭NKJV‬‬

  

This proves God as a trinity

It says let us make man in OUR OWN IMAGE

He is talking about multiple.

  

  

“And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living being.”

‭‭Genesis‬ ‭2‬:‭7‬ ‭NKJV‬‬

  

Man is a spirit

He possesses a soul

He lives in a body

  

Your body has no power.

You soul does what the spirit tells it to do

Your spirit is the head of your body.

  

No man can see God in the flesh or his flesh will die because God is a spirit.

  

It says you must be born of the Spirit to understand God.

  

Greater is in you than he that is in the world

This is talking about the Holy Spirit!!!!

# YouTube - Myles Munroe - What Is The Blood Covenant?

The Kingdom, Reconciliation, Restoration and Recolonisation of earth with Heaven.

The Blood Covenant is the Divine Vision Of God
1. The Vision of God was to colonise earth with heaven through mankind.
2. He gave mankind dominion over earth to manifest the kingdom culture of Heaven on earth 
3. Mankind was heavens colony of earth
4. The fall of man through Adam was the Declaration of Independence from the Kingdom of Heaven 
5. 
Adam is not a singular word but actually a plural word, we all are called Adam and **Adam means dark earth**, referring to the body in which the spirit of man lives, it also refers to the description of what God made. We are all called Adam and have all failed God.
(Genesis 3)

God In (Genesis 3) asks Adam “Where are you” …If God is Omnipotent (All powerful), Omniscient (all knowing), Omnipresent (Everywhere)… Why would he need to ask Adam that questions because surly He knows where Adam is?
He is asking this because Adam was now out of alignment with God.
He was out of position and out of relationship with God and Heaven.
He lost the covering of the Kingdom

> “All of us, like sheep, have strayed away. We have left God’s paths to follow our own. Yet the 
>Lord laid on him the sins of us all.”
‭‭==Isaiah‬ ‭53‬:‭6‬ ‭NLT‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/116/isa.53.6.NLT
All of us have gone astray from the Kingdoms that used to rule us.
We became independent from Heaven and the Kindom.

Sin comes from the word “Asham” which means - ‘Guilt of Rebellion‘
Every time you fight against the Kingdom that is being rebellious and that is SIN.

> “For the wages of sin (rebellion) is death”
==Romans 6:23==
In other words the payment you get when you sin is death.

So if you want to fix what Adam did you must deal with DEATH.

> “When Adam sinned, sin (Rebellion) entered the world. Adam’s sin (Rebellion) brought death, so death spread to everyone, for everyone sinned.”
‭‭==Romans‬ ‭5‬:‭12‬ ‭NLT‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/116/rom.5.12.NLT

When Adam took the apple out of Gods protective power, we inherited sin.
This is why you don’t need to teach a baby to lie or steal or be envious or be jealous because now in our genetics is sin (rebellion)

That death that took place in Adam was created by God

The devil did not create death, otherwise he would be more powerful that God.

“All things were created by God”

This includes the devil, which he originally created as ‘Lucifer’ Which means Son of the morning the leader or worship.

But there was Sin (rebellion) found inside him. This is why he is called the **Father of Sin (rebellion)** Because father means source.

> “The Lord God placed the man in the Garden of Eden to tend and watch over it. But the Lord God warned him, “You may freely eat the fruit of every tree in the garden— except the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. If you eat its fruit, you are sure to die.””
‭‭==Genesis‬ ‭2‬:‭15‬-‭17‬ ‭NLT‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/116/gen.2.15-17.NLT

The first person to introduce death to the world was GOD.
But the death created at that point could not kill.
Death existed but could not kill (He made death deathless) but He said that if Adam eats the fruit it will them activate death to kill you.

The Bible describes sin like a bee sting.
Adam put the sting in you with his Sin (rebellion) but Jesus took the sting out with his sacrifice.

God established the penalty of death.
He did not say that the devil would kill you but He would make sure you are dead.

Satan Capitalised on Gods word: he did not create the death but he instigated the rebellion which lead to the Sin and death, because he knew if he could get them to disobey God then death will kill them (God will kill them himself).

The Kindom of Heaven had 3 generals that we know of:
1. Michael (The General of the army)
2. Gabriel (The general of communication)
3. Lucifer (The general of fine arts and culture)

This is why nations get destroyed by culture
The army protects
Communication relays information
Culture controls (Causes people to follow the crowd)


Death is in the blood.
Satan is caused the accuser.

Satan knows that God HAS to keep his word once he has said it.

- In order for the law to exist there has to be a law in the first place.
- If there is no law there is no need for lawyers.
- A Lawyer is an expert in the law.
- A court room is to accuse.
- Accusation is when someone takes someone else to the law and tells the judge that you are responsible for applying the law to this person for breaking the law.
- The accuser is the one that demands that the law is kept and wants a penalty

> “Then I heard a loud voice shouting across the heavens, “It has come at last— salvation and power and the Kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Christ. For the accuser of our brothers and sisters has been thrown down to earth— the one who accuses them before our God day and night. And they have defeated him by the blood of the Lamb and by their testimony. And they did not love their lives so much that they were afraid to die.”
==‭‭Revelation‬ ‭12‬:‭10‬-‭11‬ ‭NLT‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/116/rev.12.10-11.NLT

As soon as Adam sinned (Rebelled) Satan ran straight to God (Heaven) and said ‘I’ve got you, you have to keep your word because you do not lie also you have to kill all of them’

Satan is the accuser DAY AND NIGHT that is why you always feel guilty even when you know you are forgiven you might feel guilty years later because Satan accuses DAY AND NIGHT.
And he does not stop because once you accept the accusation then you plead guilty. And once you plead guilty then the penalty of the accusation will kick in and kill you.

Pleading the blood is not in the bible anywhere.

The bible actually says:
1. All life is in the blood 
    (Scientifically when you eat food the blood takes it found the body, same with anything you consume, the blood keeps you healthy)
2. All healing is in the blood 
    (Scientifically you blood heals you, when there is a bruise it is your blood rushing to that place and fighting to heal that part, same with scratches)
3. All nutrients are in the blood
4. All protection is in the blood 
    (Same as healing, your blood actually protections you.)
5. You can only kill someone or something if you get to their blood.
    (If you want to kill someone you must poison their BLOOD, if you want to shoot someone it’s not the gun that kills you, it is the blood loss that kills you.
    All the organs in your body serve the blood, your heart pumps blood.
    Your liver purifies your blood.

Christians have had a transfusion with Jesus’ blood and this has made us alive again.
Our blood was contaminated in sin and couldn’t protect us from death.

Everyone was contaminated with Sin because of Adam meaning no one could help each other as we all had the same disease.
This is why Jesus was so important because He was not born of man so had the only purified blood on the earth!

> ““And if any native Israelite or foreigner living among you eats or drinks blood in any form, I will turn against that person and cut him off from the community of your people, for the life of the body is in its blood. I have given you the blood on the altar to purify you, making you right with the Lord. It is the blood, given in exchange for a life, that makes purification possible.”
‭‭==Leviticus‬ ‭17‬:‭10‬-‭11‬ ‭NLT‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/116/lev.17.10-11.NLT

God is saying that humans blood was contaminated so he had to use animal blood to purify us. But this is not sustainable because there are not enough sheep and animals in the world to be sacrificing every day!

> “The life of every creature is in its blood. That is why I have said to the people of Israel, ‘You must never eat or drink blood, for the life of any creature is in its blood.’ So whoever consumes blood will be cut off from the community.”
‭‭==Leviticus‬ ‭17‬:‭14‬ ‭NLT‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/116/lev.17.14.NLT

God says all the way through the bible, you must not drink blood of anything that has come from the earth because it will have disease, sickness and anything bad that that animal of person had!
But if you can find pure/holy/healthy blood and that is Jesus.

That is why the before Jesus died he said to the disciples ‘in THIS CUP, this is MY BLOOD, drink it’
And this is the first time in HISTORY this was ever said!

Jesus is the only person in history, out of all the religions that someone who had pure blood died just to give it to His followers.

CAIN AND ABEL
When they came with their sacrifices.
Cain brought fruits
Abel brought 1 sheep
Abels was accepted because it had BLOOD.

Cain represents all religions, they come with all their rituals etc but not blood.
Abel represents Christians who come with blood.

> “The priest will take one of the male lambs and the olive oil and present them as a guilt offering, lifting them up as a special offering before the Lord. He will then slaughter the male lamb in the sacred area where sin offerings and burnt offerings are slaughtered. As with the sin offering, the guilt offering belongs to the priest. It is a most holy offering. The priest will then take some of the blood of the guilt offering and apply it to the lobe of the right ear, the thumb of the right hand, and the big toe of the right foot of the person being purified. “Then the priest will pour some of the olive oil into the palm of his own left hand.”
==‭‭Leviticus‬ ‭14‬:‭12‬-‭15‬ ‭NLT==‬‬
https://bible.com/bible/116/lev.14.12-15.NLT

> ““Should I ransom them from the grave? Should I redeem them from death? O death, bring on your terrors! O grave, bring on your plagues! For I will not take pity on them.”
‭‭==Hosea‬ ‭13‬:‭14‬ ‭NLT‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/116/hos.13.14.NLT

This is talking about God doing something that our body wont then get sick and decay.
This is the cross and resurrection in one verse!

Cruicifiction is the most bloody death ever created.

God had to create another ADAM to fix everything but he couldn’t have it from the earth.
It’s why it says the Son of God - LAST ADAM. 
LAST means ORIGINAL.

When you have a printing press you have a specific stencle or thing you are going to print on the paper. The first Adam is the first print from a printing press but imagine someone has spilled drink over the first print which means it is all ruined and you cannot see the original image on the print.
But it is okay because you still have the original stencle that it was printed from.
We have been reprinted, restored, revived when Jesus was printed (The last Adam, The Second Man) from then on there was a new stack of papers that was not spoiled and now in the original image of the stencle (image of God).

> “The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, “Look! The Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world! He is the one I was talking about when I said, ‘A man is coming after me who is far greater than I am, for he existed long before me.’ I did not recognize him as the Messiah, but I have been baptizing with water so that he might be revealed to Israel.””
‭‭==John‬ ‭1‬:‭29‬-‭31‬ ‭NLT‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/116/jhn.1.29-31.NLT

For 4000 years everyone brought their own lamb to the alter, bringing their own blood.
But God is saying that you do not need to anymore!
God is saying, I will bring one for you, from His own flock right from heaven, once and for all ‘The Lamb Of God‘. 

This chapter and verse was when John saw Jesus as something else.
He had been brought up with Jesus as they were cousins but he had the revelation and the foresight at this very moment of Jesus and what He was that he never had seen before ‘The Lamb Of God’.

Good Friday is you standing in a court room.
You being accused and you say yes I am guilty so there is a sentencing the next day.
You go back to the court room the next day for your sentencing and when the judge reads the verdict it says ‘you will spend eternity in damnation for what you have done’
Then someone walks through the side entrance and says ‘I AM HERE’ ‘I will go to prison for them, let them go’
The judge gets angry and says ‘but THEY sinned, THEY broke the law’
And the man said ‘I know, i created the law, I created them, I created you and I will not violate my law’
So he says ‘the law says, if any man sins they shall surly die’
‘So all you need is a man, and i am a man so let them go’

When Jesus broke the bread and poured the wine he was saying this is reconciliation between the Kingdom of Heaven, the relationship is restored between God and Man, a new contract has been signed and there will be life instead of death.

‘IT IS FINISHED’

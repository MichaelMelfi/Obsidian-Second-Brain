# YouTube - Kenneth Copeland - Living A Life Of Great Faith

Jesus is the high priest of your words so it will come to pass.
Speak what you want with faith with no doubt in your mind and it will come to pass!
Out of your belly shall flow rivers of living water
Keep the switch of faith always on!

#### Faith and freedom on Saul to Paul
> “Now when He concluded all His sayings in the hearing of the people, He entered Capernaum. And a certain centurion’s servant, who was dear to him, was sick and ready to die. So when he heard about Jesus, he sent elders of the Jews to Him, pleading with Him to come and heal his servant. And when they came to Jesus, they begged Him earnestly, saying that the one for whom He should do this was deserving, “for he loves our nation, and has built us a synagogue.” Then Jesus went with them. And when He was already not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to Him, saying to Him, “Lord, do not trouble Yourself, for I am not worthy that You should enter under my roof. Therefore I did not even think myself worthy to come to You. But say the word, and my servant will be healed. For I also am a man placed under authority, having soldiers under me. And I say to one, ‘Go,’ and he goes; and to another, ‘Come,’ and he comes; and to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.” When Jesus heard these things, He marveled at him, and turned around and said to the crowd that followed Him, “I say to you, I have not found such great faith, not even in Israel!” And those who were sent, returning to the house, found the servant well who had been sick.”
‭‭==Luke‬ ‭7‬:‭1‬-‭10‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/luk.7.1-10.NKJV

Great faith is not about being a great person, but it is available to any Christian because WE HAVE JESUS’ FAITH

We have known and believed the love of Jesus.
> “There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus, who do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit. For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death.”
‭‭==Romans‬ ‭8‬:‭1‬-‭2‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/rom.8.2.NKJV

For there is **NOW** no condemnation.
Every time you read this verse it upgrades as it is talking about NOW, and that is whenever the time you are reading it is.

Your past only exist in your head and that is the thing Satan try’s to get you to remember.

The Apostle Paul Killed Christians, he held the guys coats while they stoned Steven.
YET - When the lord came to him he gave his life to him and the Lord NEVER brought up that sin to him ever again.
Paul brought it up to the Lord, he brought it up in a vision when he was talking to God and God didn’t even Ignolage he said it.

WHY?

Because when Paul gave his life to the Lord, His old self died.

> “Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new.”
‭‭==II Corinthians‬ ‭5‬:‭17‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/2co.5.17.NKJV

> “Open your hearts to us. We have wronged no one, we have corrupted no one, we have cheated no one.”
==‭‭II Corinthians‬ ‭7‬:‭2‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/2co.7.2.NKJV

How can Paul say this if he has helped kill Christians???
BECAUSE HIS OLD SELF IS DEAD.

I can now say because i am saved I did not do anything before i was baptised!

A new being, a new creature, was born and made alive!

A general in the Civil war between the South and North America he used **t**o just sit up out of the trench, a private asked him why do you just sit up there aren’t you afraid you will get hit?
He said, son, if you have accepted Jesus as your Lord and saviours, you are just as safe on the battlefield field that at home in bed

It is the same for us!

We need to go to Psalm 91 and believe this.

#### Light speed
The Spirit realm is more real that our realm
We cannot see it because it is moving at the speed of light. 186000 miles a second

Everything this is made of atoms and molecular things and the same is for the spirit realm but everything is moving at the speed of light which makes it impossible for our eyes to see.
There is so much there and its always there, but we cannot see it!

We do not look at the things that are temporary but the things that are unseen.

The light line is Gods realm and it is the speed of light
Below the light line is where the fallen angels are, it is where Adam became after sinning.

> “But the free gift is not like the offense. For if by the one man’s offense many died, much more the grace of God and the gift by the grace of the one Man, Jesus Christ, abounded to many.”
‭‭==Romans‬ ‭5‬:‭15‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/rom.5.15.NKJV

> “For if by the one man’s offense death reigned through the one, much more those who receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness will reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ.)”
‭‭==Romans‬ ‭5‬:‭17‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/rom.5.17.NKJV

This is talking about that what Jesus did on the Cross is FAR MORE greater than what Satan did.

Think of it like a cloud of righteousness that hovers over every single human at the speed of light but has not entered them yet.

We are children on the light (God is the light), we put on the armour of light and we walk in the light as He walks in the light.

When you accept Jesus as your Lord and Saviour, it is like that cloud of righteousness at the speed of light, strikes your spirit and kills the old man you were and your spirit becomes at the light speed!

So now all of God has entered you, everything ab out him entered you.
His Joy
His Love
His Presence 
His Faith

You are made the Righteousness of God in Him.
And he put his Faith in you

And all this moves at the speed of light.
This is all in the energy realm
This is how you have the power and authority.

This is why you are able to bring things out of that light realm
“Being the substance hoped for”
You bring substance to those things and they manifest in this natural realm.

That why you have to stay in faith, just because you can’t see it doesn’t mean it’s not working.

When you accept Jesus as your Lord and Saviour
“He has blessed us with all spiritual blessings, in heavenly places”
And the moment you did this the heavenly came inside you, the kingdom of God came in you.

It says you are a citizen of Heaven
Fix your affection on things above.
The only reason you are still here is because you are a soldier of Go.
You are not here to make a living, you are here on this word to be a whiteness to God.

If you have lost keys, do not keep saying you’ve lost your keys.
Talk to God and say, I know you know where the keys are.
So show me where these keys are.

> “And Jesus went into Jerusalem and into the temple. So when He had looked around at all things, as the hour was already late, He went out to Bethany with the twelve.”
‭‭==Mark‬ ‭11‬:‭11‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/mrk.11.11.NKJV

#### Steps of faith 

The First Step of Faith:
He went to enquire and see what was happening
Jesus did not cleanse the temple that day because of the below.

> “Now the next day, when they had come out from Bethany, He was hungry. And seeing from afar a fig tree having leaves, He went to see if perhaps He would find something on it. When He came to it, He found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs. In response Jesus said to it, “Let no one eat fruit from you ever again.” And His disciples heard it.”
‭‭==Mark‬ ‭11‬:‭12‬-‭14‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/mrk.11.14.NKJV

You do not realise how much you have to talk back to things!

And his disciples heard it, so he was not quiet about it.

He saw the fig tree from a FAR OFF (fig trees are massive).

He spoke to the tree then they went to Jerusalem, he did not wait to see if what he said worked, he just went straight away.
As far as faith is concerned the fig tree is dead.

> “So they came to Jerusalem. Then Jesus went into the temple and began to drive out those who bought and sold in the temple, and overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who sold doves.”
‭‭==Mark‬ ‭11‬:‭15‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/mrk.11.15.NKJV

The second step of faith:
He acted on what he saw and rebuked everything

> “And He would not allow anyone to carry wares through the temple. Then He taught, saying to them, “Is it not written, ‘My house shall be called a house of prayer for all nations’? But you have made it a ‘den of thieves.’ ” And the scribes and chief priests heard it and sought how they might destroy Him; for they feared Him, because all the people were astonished at His teaching. When evening had come, He went out of the city.”
‭‭==Mark‬ ‭11‬:‭16‬-‭19‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/mrk.11.16-19.NKJV

The Third step of faith:
HE PREACHED THE WHOLE DAY.
He then taught them what to do until evening came!!!


> “Now in the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots. And Peter, remembering, said to Him, “Rabbi, look! The fig tree which You cursed has withered away.””
‭‭==Mark‬ ‭11‬:‭20‬-‭21‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/mrk.11.20-21.NKJV

It dried up from where you cannot see it to where you could
It dried up FROM THE ROOTS.
Deal with the root and the rest cannot grow or prosper.

The devil hates that we are BLESSED.
The devil got mad a God when he was trying to get to Job.
He said “There is a wall around him!!”
“Does he serve you for nothing? You have BLESSED him!”

> “So Satan answered the Lord and said, “Does Job fear God for nothing? Have You not made a hedge around him, around his household, and around all that he has on every side? You have BLESSED the work of his hands, and his possessions have increased in the land.”
==‭‭Job‬ ‭1‬:‭9‬-‭10‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/job.1.9-10.NKJV



> “So Jesus answered and said to them, “Have faith in God. For assuredly, I say to you, whoever says to this mountain, ‘Be removed and be cast into the sea,’ and does not doubt in his heart, but believes that those things he says will be done, he will have whatever he says. Therefore I say to you, whatever things you ask when you pray, believe that you receive them, and you will have them.”
‭‭==Mark‬ ‭11‬:‭22‬-‭24‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/mrk.11.22-24.NKJV

You have the power to cast out what you don’t want.
You have the power to bring in what you desire.

#### Inheritance and blessings

> “A good man leaves an inheritance to his children’s children, But the wealth of the sinner is stored up for the righteous.”
‭‭==Proverbs‬ ‭13‬:‭22‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/pro.13.22.NKJV
> “A good man leaves an inheritance to his children’s children, And the wealth of the sinner is stored up for [the hands of] the righteous.”
‭‭==Proverbs‬ ‭13‬:‭22‬ ‭AMP‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/1588/pro.13.22.AMP

Be faithful to God and the wealth of the wicked and sinners will find its way to you!

> ““Now it shall come to pass, if you diligently obey the voice of the Lord your God, to observe carefully all His commandments which I command you today, that the Lord your God will set you high above all nations of the earth. And all these blessings shall come upon you and overtake you, because you obey the voice of the Lord your God:”
‭‭==Deuteronomy‬ ‭28‬:‭1‬-‭2‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/deu.28.1-2.NKJV

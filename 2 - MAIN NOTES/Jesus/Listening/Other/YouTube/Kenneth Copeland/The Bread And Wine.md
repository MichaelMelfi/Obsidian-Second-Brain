# The Bread And Wine (New Covenant)

The Bread And Wine is the new covenant confirmed with Jesusâ€™ blood.

He was manifested in Bethlehem but he was made alive in the spirit and the first man to be born again, in the pit of hell.

Plead the blood over your life.
By pleading the blood, you are literally hitting Satan with every word of the New Testament.

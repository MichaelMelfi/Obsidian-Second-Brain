##### What Did I Learn From This Teaching?:
To anoint = to rub
Gods anointing is His nature [[YWAM - 6th Week - NATURE AND CHARACTER OF GOD (FATHER HEART OF GOD) 2-1 - Jonathan Vergauwen - Who Is God?]]
No matter what is going on around you, speak with faith that ALL IS WELL
The power of company - be around anointed people so their anointing rubs off on you.

You must go through 4 places before you receive the anointing.
Gilgal = Walk by faith not sight
Bethel = Let God kill your flesh
Jericho = Victory over the enemy
Jordan = Opening your eyes to the spirit

Use the anointing that falls to you.
Pick it up the anointing and demand of it!
# YouTube - Benny Hinn - How to prepare and What Will You Do With The Anointing? - Elisha


## What is the anointing?
The presence of the Lord
The power of the Lord coming on someone
The word anoint means to rub
When a farmer anoints a sheep with oil it is to keep the bugs away.

It is the same with us.
The lord is our Shepard and He rubs his anointing on us to keep the bugs away / demons away.
He rubs his anointing which is His NATURE on us.

Nature: https://www.ffministry.com/blog/what-is-the-nature-of-god#:~:text=At%20its%20core%2C%20the%20Christian,power%2C%20knowledge%2C%20and%20presence.
- God Is All Powerful - omnipotent
- God Is All Knowing - omniscient
- God Is Everywhere (Always Present) - omnipresent

Everything you see in the old Testament/old covenant is a shadow and everything you see in the new Testiment/new covenant is substance.

We live in the substance!

When a light hits an object it reflects what the object or shadow is.
The shadow only changes when the object/substance moves.

We are the substance as Christ Jesus is in us!

The old covenant people still had power just with the shadow.
Think how much more power we have as the substance!

It is so important to be with people who also walk in the steps of God as they rub off on you!

## ALL IS WELL!
2 Kings 4:18-37
The Shunammite woman’s son died, she went and laid the boy in the prophets chamber.
The husband said ’is all well?’
Elisha’s servant said ‘is all well?’
The woman said ALL IS WELL even though her son is dead because she was talking with faith.

> “And he said, “Why will you go to him today? It is neither new moon nor Sabbath.” She said, “All is well.””
‭‭==2 Kings‬ ‭4‬:‭23‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/2ki.4.23.ESV

> “So she set out and came to the man of God at Mount Carmel. When the man of God saw her coming, he said to Gehazi his servant, “Look, there is the Shunammite. Run at once to meet her and say to her, ‘Is all well with you? Is all well with your husband? Is all well with the child?’” And she answered, “All is well.””
‭‭==2 Kings‬ ‭4‬:‭25‬-‭26‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/2ki.4.25-26.ESV


## The Power of company
Elisha knew the power of company and with who you spend you time with will rub off on you.
So he spent all his days around Elijah so the anointing would rub off on him.

Who are you hanging around with?
Who are you trying to rub off of?

Be around anointed people.


## 4 places Elijah took Elisha to get his anointing

### 1 Verse 1 - Gilgal (Walk by FAITH not by SIGHT)
> “Now when the Lord was about to take Elijah up to heaven by a whirlwind, Elijah and Elisha were on their way from Gilgal.”
==‭‭2 Kings‬ ‭2‬:‭1‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/2ki.2.1.ESV

Why are they coming from Gilgal?
SIGHT DIES AND YOU WALK BY FAITH

Elisha had to go through Gilgal before he could have the anointing.
We must all go through Gilgal to get our anointing on our lives.

> “And the Lord said to Joshua, “Today I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt from you.” And so the name of that place is called Gilgal to this day. While the people of Israel were encamped at Gilgal, they kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month in the evening on the plains of Jericho. And the day after the Passover, on that very day, they ate of the produce of the land, unleavened cakes and parched grain. And the manna ceased the day after they ate of the produce of the land. And there was no longer manna for the people of Israel, but they ate of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.”
‭‭==Joshua‬ ‭5‬:‭9‬-‭12‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/jos.5.9-12.ESV

#### What happened at Gilgal?
Egypt was behind them (Egypt is symbolic of the world and your old life)
In Gilgal the manna stopped.
For 40 years before they got to Gilgal and was walking in the desert, Israel walked through the wilderness and God had to lead them.
In day the cloud led them.
At night the fire covered them.

The bible says that the cloud would move and if the Israelites didn’t follow the cloud and stay under its shadow the Amalakits would kill them so they had to stay covered by the cloud and the fire.
These are symbolic of the presence of God.

BUT as soon as they got to Gilgal the Manna stopped and there is no longer any mention of the cloud and the fire.

For the 40 years before, the Israelites had to walk but SIGHT
But when they walked into Gilgal they had to start walking by FATH

Gilgal is the place where you have to walk by faith and live by faith.

He did this to switch locations!
He wanted to take the cloud and fire away from their eyes and put it into their hearts.

FAITH was the first thing God introduced into the Israelites.

Everyone who wants the anointing has to first stop walking by sight like in the wilderness and in Egypt but start walking by faith!

Gilgal is the place faith becomes reality.

#### What happens when faith goes into your life?
> “Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen. 
> For by it the people of old received their commendation. 
> By faith we understand that the universe was created by the word of God, so that what is seen was not made out of things that are visible. 
> By faith Abel offered to God a more acceptable sacrifice than Cain, through which he was commended as righteous, God commending him by accepting his gifts. And through his faith, though he died, he still speaks.
> By faith Enoch was taken up so that he should not see death, and he was not found, because God had taken him. 
> Now before he was taken he was commended as having pleased God. And without faith it is impossible to please him, for whoever would draw near to God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him.”
‭‭==Hebrews‬ ‭11‬:‭1‬-‭6‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/heb.11.1-6.ESV

Hope is in your mind
Faith is in your heart.

Faith always has a destination (Faith believed unto)
Faith will produce SUBSTANCE
Faith will produce EVIDENCE
Faith will produce good report in the eyes of God
Faith will produce UNDERSTANDING
Faith will produce an acceptable and Righteous SACRIFICE to God
Faith will produce translation (It translates for me from what is NATURAL to what is SPIRITUAL)
Faith will produce PLEASING GOD

If you want the anointing of God you have to walk by faith and not sight.

Faith is a person!
> “Since we have the same spirit of faith according to what has been written, “I believed, and so I spoke,” we also believe, and so we also speak,”
‭‭==2 Corinthians‬ ‭4‬:‭13‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/2co.4.13.ESV



### 2 Verse 2 - Bethel (Your FLESH dying)

> “And Elijah said to Elisha, “Please stay here, for the Lord has sent me as far as Bethel.” But Elisha said, “As the Lord lives, and as you yourself live, I will not leave you.” So they went down to Bethel.”
‭‭==2 Kings‬ ‭2‬:‭2‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/2ki.2.2.ESV
YOUR FLESH DIES
Satan cannot win when the flesh is dead
#### Jacob Wresting With God
Genesis 28
Bethel was the place where Jacob died and Israel lived.
Jacob had a lot of problems
He deceived his father
He was not clean in his heart

Jacob wrestled with God
Wresting with God kills your flesh!
Prayer is wresting with God
Let God wrestle with you as he is wanting to kill your flesh!

This is where Jacob did not let God leave until he got his blessing
And at the end of the wresting match, God said to Jacob you arenot Jacob but Israel, you are a price with God now.

Bethel is where your flesh dies.

You must walk by faith first before killing your flesh as your flesh only goes by what it sees.

#### Saul Wresting With Samuel
> “And Samuel said to Saul, “I will not return with you. For you have rejected the word of the Lord, and the Lord has rejected you from being king over Israel.” As Samuel turned to go away, Saul seized the skirt of his robe, and it tore. And Samuel said to him, “The Lord has torn the kingdom of Israel from you this day and has given it to a neighbor of yours, who is better than you.”
==‭‭1 Samuel‬ ‭15‬:‭26‬-‭28‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/1sa.15.27-28.ESV

After this Saul ends up dying

Jacob wrestled with God and got accepted.
Saul wrestled with man and got rejected

Never fight with man
Let God do your fighting


### 3 Verse 4 - Jericho (VICTORY over the enemy)
> “Elijah said to him, “Elisha, please stay here, for the Lord has sent me to Jericho.” But he said, “As the Lord lives, and as you yourself live, I will not leave you.” So they came to Jericho.”
==‭‭2 Kings‬ ‭2‬:‭4‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/2ki.2.4.ESV

THE ENEMY DIES AND YOU WALK IN VICTORY
Jericho is where there was battles!
At Jericho the battle was won!

#### Joshua and the walls of Jericho
Joshua 6:1-27

They had to walk around the walls 7 times then shouted
Why did they walk around 7 times?
By the 7th time, their flesh was now dead meaning Satan could not kill of defeat them

Why did they shout?

> “Clap your hands, all peoples! Shout to God with loud songs of joy! For the Lord, the Most High, is to be feared, a great king over all the earth. He subdued peoples under us, and nations under our feet.”
‭‭==Psalm‬ ‭47‬:‭1‬-‭3‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/psa.47.3.ESV

When you shout unto, God puts people under you
It said God went up in a shout.
When we shout, God goes up and he subjews people under us

Shouting drives demons away.

When you shout unto God with a voice of triumph, demons leave.

#### Jesus Tempted
Matthew 4:1-11
Jericho is where Jesus was tempted by Satan.
This is where Jesus defeated the Satan

### 4 Verse 6 - Jordan (The place of Vision The Eyes of The SPIRIT)
> “Then Elijah said to him, “Please stay here, for the Lord has sent me to the Jordan.” But he said, “As the Lord lives, and as you yourself live, I will not leave you.” So the two of them went on.”
‭‭==2 Kings‬ ‭2‬:‭6‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/2ki.2.6.ESV

Jordan is where the eyes of the spirit open up.

Jordan is where Elijah ascended to Heaven
John the Baptist was the Holy Ghost descending like a dove at Jordan
John the Baptist saw the heavens open up at Jordan
The father said this is my beloved son at Jordan

> “And he said, “You have asked a hard thing; yet, if you see me as I am being taken from you, it shall be so for you, but if you do not see me, it shall not be so.” And as they still went on and talked, behold, chariots of fire and horses of fire separated the two of them. And Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven. And Elisha saw it and he cried, “My father, my father! The chariots of Israel and its horsemen!” And he saw him no more. Then he took hold of his own clothes and tore them in two pieces. And he took up the cloak of Elijah that had fallen from him and went back and stood on the bank of the Jordan. Then he took the cloak of Elijah that had fallen from him and struck the water, saying, “Where is the Lord, the God of Elijah?” And when he had struck the water, the water was parted to the one side and to the other, and Elisha went over.”
‭‭==2 Kings‬ ‭2‬:‭10‬-‭14‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/2ki.2.10-14.ESV

### Pick up your Mantel/Anointing

Elisha saw the mantel (anointing) fall from Elijah.

It is up to you what you do with the mantel / anointing that’s falls to you
Now a lot of people in the world, build a monument around their anointing and don't use it.
Others end up cutting it up and selling it as merchandise.
But thank God there are people who pick up the anointing and use it!
We must pick up the mantel / anointing and say 
‘IN THE NAME OF JESUS COME ALIVE IN ME’
‘WHERE IS THE GOD OF ELIJAH’
‘USE ME FOR YOUR GLORY’
‘I WILL USE THIS ANOINTING FOR THE GLORY OF THE LORD’

ONCE YOU HAVE THE ANOINTING, NOTHING CAN COME AGAINST YOU!!!!

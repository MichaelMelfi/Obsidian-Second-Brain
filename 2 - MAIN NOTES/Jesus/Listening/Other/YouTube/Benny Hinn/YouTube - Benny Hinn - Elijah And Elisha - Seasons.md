##### What Did I Learn From This Teaching?:


# YouTube - Benny Hinn - Elijah And Elisha - Seasons

When God moves in a season, there is a fresh voice and sound
You must understand seasons
A new season brings a new calling and anointing

Moses
1. First Season - While he lived in Egypt and was the son of Pharos sister.
It ended when he left Egypt and fled from the king as he killed the Egyptian
He was being trained and given wisdom

2. Second Season - At the burning bush
this ends when he brings the Israelites out of Egypt
He was the saviour and deliverer

3. Third Season - He made the 10 commandments
This ends when he dies
He was their teacher


Jesus
1. First Season - when He is a child
We dont know when this season started, it could have started at birth, at circumsision.
The bible says it stopped in his young life when God started to reveal the word of salvation to his son.

2. Second Season - When He was baptised in the river Jordan.
That finished when he died on the cross and said “It Is Finished”

3. Third Season - The resurrection
Continues eternally



Elisha
1. First Season - A prophet

2. Second Season - Elijahs helper
He served man as he wasn’t ready to serve God yet.

3. Third Season - He picked up the mantel and served God

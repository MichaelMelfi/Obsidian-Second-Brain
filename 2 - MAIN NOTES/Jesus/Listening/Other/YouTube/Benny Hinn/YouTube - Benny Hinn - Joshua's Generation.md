##### What Did I Learn From This Teaching?:
We are living in substance!
You cannot win a battle with slaves
Every miracle from when Israel became free of Egypt represents what happens with us.
You cannot fight without the word of God
DO NOT LEAVE WHERE YOU ARE UNTIL YOU GET WHAT YOU CAME FOR.
Make the presence of God your home
When you are saved, your old self and everything up to Adam is dries up and dies.
Revelation about the ark and the presence of God in us.
When God tells us to be quiet, it’s because he is standing up.
Praise is the same as trumpets and it confuses the enemy and makes them fight themselves.
When we shout, God shouts with us.
We have won against all the 5 kings that Joshua fought against.

# YouTube - Benny Hinn - Joshua's Generation

We must take what God has promised us by force and demand of it!
The devil is not a nice devil, so why should we be nice to him?
He has taken by force what belongs to you so we must take it back by force.

## The Supernatural Generation - Substance

We are the supernatural generation as everything we have and are now is SUBSTANCE.

Everything you see in the old Testament/old covenant is a shadow and everything you see in the new Testiment/new covenant is substance.
We live in the substance!
When a light hits an object it reflects what the object or shadow is.
The shadow only changes when the object/substance moves.

We are the substance as Christ Jesus is in us!

The old covenant people still had power just with the shadow.
Think how much more power we have as the substance!

## Who is the Joshua Generation?
The Joshua Generation are people who start their life with the miracle working power of God.

The Joshua Generation were children of slaves.
For 400 years their parents only saw the darkness and slavery of Egypt and the harm of Pharo’s whip.
They only knew, poverty, pain, sadness, darkness and oppression.
The Joshua generation were the ones who grew up out of slavery and once they had left Egypt!

Their parents knew about God but they all had a mentality of slaves as that’s all they were surrounded by.
And once they had left Egypt and became free they still had the slavery mindset!

BUT the children who were 1-2-3-4 years of age did not know anything and would not remember about the slavery of Egypt, they would not have known what the whip felt like, darkness felt like.

The parents would have started their life with a whip and darkness.
But as they walk out of Egypt the children’s lives began with God deviding an ocean.

The Joshua Generation are the ones who’s lives started with the spiritual supernatural mirecals of God.

God had to make sure the parents died in the wilderness as you cannot invade with a bunch of slaves.
They had to walk for 40 years just so the parents would die off.
They could have easily made it to the promise land in 11 days by walking but God could not do anything with people with a slave mid set!

You cannot win as a slave and God couldn’t get the slavery mindset out of them.
It even says that the people ‘Went back to Egypt in their hearts’ 

But the children came out of Egypt and saw Gods mirecals.

## What miracles did Joshuas generation grow up with?
1. God divide the ocean.
2. God Stopped the Egyptians chariot wheels from working! Some translations says that God blew off the wheels - Exodus 14:25
3. Cloud by day, Fire by night
4. Raining bread - Exodus 16:4
5. The shoes do not ware out
The Egyptians were running after Gods peoplebut God stopped their wheels from working so they could not catch up to them!

> “clogging their chariot wheels so that they drove heavily. And the Egyptians said, “Let us flee from before Israel, for the Lord fights for them against the Egyptians.””
‭‭==Exodus‬ ‭14‬:‭25‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/exo.14.25.ESV

For 40 years the cloud and fire guided them.

Some people say wouldn’t it have been amazing to have a cloud and fire guiding you.
We have something better, we have the cloud of fire inside of us!!

People say wouldn’t it be amazing to see God split an ocean.
God did the same for us when He took us out of bondage and slavery!

Egypt symbolises the world.
When God took us out of bondage and slavery of the world.
He divided an ocean for us and create a path for us to walk out free (Baptised in water)
He destroyed all of the enemy behind us!
The Holy Spirit then met us on the other side! (The Cloud and the fire) (Baptised in the fire of the Holy Spirit)
He feeds us with the word of God
He clothed us in righteousness!

They had the shadow and we have the substance.
They have the natural we have the supernatural.


> “Then the Lord said to Moses, “Behold, I am about to rain bread from heaven for you, and the people shall go out and gather a day’s portion every day, that I may test them, whether they will walk in my law or not.”
‭‭==Exodus‬ ‭16‬:‭4‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/exo.16.4.ESV

The Bread represents the word of God that feeds us!

The clothes and shoes that never wear out is amazing
But what we are wearing is better are they garments or praise and righteousness!!

## Joshua

### Fight
> “So Moses said to Joshua, “Choose for us men, and go out and fight with Amalek. Tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the staff of God in my hand.””
‭‭==Exodus‬ ‭17‬:‭9‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/exo.17.9.ESV

The first place we hear about Joshua is in chapter 17 and the first thing he is commanded to do is FIGHT.

> “Then the Lord said to Moses, “Write this as a memorial in a book and recite it in the ears of Joshua, that I will utterly blot out the memory of Amalek from under heaven.””
‭‭==Exodus‬ ‭17‬:‭14‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/exo.17.14.ESV

You cannot fight without the word of God.
Moses had to rehearse the Word of God in Joshuas ear before we went to fight.

### Presents of God
Joshua loves the presents of God
Moses used to speak with God face to face, however when Moses went to leave the tabernacle.
He turned and Joshua would not leave until he had spoken to God.

> “Thus the Lord used to speak to Moses face to face, as a man speaks to his friend. When Moses turned again into the camp, his assistant Joshua the son of Nun, a young man, would not depart from the tent.”
‭‭==Exodus‬ ‭33‬:‭11‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/exo.33.11.ESV

Joshua lived in the tabernacle
Joshua loved Gods house

> “from the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea the son of Nun; These were the names of the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land. And Moses called Hoshea the son of Nun Joshua.”
‭‭==Numbers‬ ‭13‬:‭8‬, ‭16‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/num.13.8-16.ESV

Joshuas name was actually Hoshea
The word Hoshea = saved
The word Ye in Hebrew = The I am
The word Joshua (Or pronounced properly Yeshua) = God saves or God is salvation

Before this there was not a name where God name had been added to it
The name Ye is the name of God.

### Arise

> “After the death of Moses the servant of the Lord, the Lord said to Joshua the son of Nun, Moses’ assistant, “Moses my servant is dead. Now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, you and all this people, into the land that I am giving to them, to the people of Israel.”
‭‭==Joshua‬ ‭1‬:‭1‬-‭2‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/jos.1.1-2.ESV

### Walking out of the flesh and into the spirit - Walking in Jordan
[[YouTube - Benny Hinn - How to prepare and What Will You Do With The Anointing? - Elisha]]
Read this to understand more about the cities!!!

Now the city of Gilgal is the city of flesh

The city of Jordan is the city where you walk in the spirit.
Jesus was baptised in Jordan.
Elijah ascended at Jordan.
Elisha took his double portion at Jordan
John the baptised prophesied at the Jordan.

> “the waters coming down from above stood and rose up in a heap very far away, at Adam, the city that is beside Zarethan, and those flowing down toward the Sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, were completely cut off. And the people passed over opposite Jericho.”
‭‭==Joshua‬ ‭3‬:‭16‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/jos.3.16.ESV

In this verse, why did the water dry up all the way back to the city of Adam (This is where Adam lived)
The City of Adam is 30 miles up river from the Jordan. Why on earth did it have to dry up 30 miles away from Joshua?? They could have walked through the water with it dried up meters away from them. Why did God dry up 30 miles????

This is because God is signifying new life and stepping into spirit from flesh.

God is saying, when you stop walking in Flesh and start walking in Spirit, everything from that point all the way back to where the flesh was created is wiped away!
When you are made as a new creation in Christ, your past is wiped away and your old things a d everything you did and were before are now dried up and passed away!

It also signifies that everything Adam did is also wiped from your life.

The only thing the devil has is your past.
You can say to him that you have no past as it was all wiped away!

I HAVE NO PAST

### The 12 Stones
> “and command them, saying, ‘Take twelve stones from here out of the midst of the Jordan, from the very place where the priests’ feet stood firmly, and bring them over with you and lay them down in the place where you lodge tonight.’””
‭‭==Joshua‬ ‭4‬:‭3‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/jos.4.3.ESV

> “And Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of the Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests bearing the ark of the covenant had stood; and they are there to this day.”
‭‭==Joshua‬ ‭4‬:‭9‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/jos.4.9.ESV

They put 12 stones from the river and placed them on the promise land side.
Israel goes through
Then Joshua takes 12 stones from the wilderness side and places them in the river where the other 12 stones came from.

The stones represents the church
Every time you see stones in the bible it represents the church
Peter says (You are lively stones)

The 12 stones from the river to the promise land represent the church was born out of the spirit and put on the promise land
The other stones that Joshua took represent the old covenant church where they are saying bye this is now a new beginning.

John’s the baptised in Matthew 3
> “And do not presume to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father,’ for I tell you, God is able from these stones to raise up children for Abraham.”
‭‭==Matthew‬ ‭3‬:‭9‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/mat.3.9.ESV

He is talking about the stones that they took from the Jordan and it represents the children of Israel that got given new life and be made new in spirit.


Then after they cross and the water goes back.
The old stones are buried in the spirit and the new stones come out of the spirit.

### The ARK

Where is the ark?
The ark used to be a box and the presents of God was only in the box.
Now it is in us, his presents dwells in us!

Back in those days, if anyone touched the ark they died
It is in us and we do not die!

Back in the day if anyone touched the presence of God (the ark) they died
And how we have the presence of God in us and we do not die.
The reason the people back in the day died when they touched the presence of God was because it’s the flesh that dies and all they had back in the Old Testament was their flesh.
When we touch the presence of God the exact same thing happens with us and it’s our flesh that dies just like in the Old Testament, However, we have the capability to be able to swap our flesh which dies and change it for the Holy Spirit and that is now what keeps us alive.
And that’s why it says our old self is dead. Because our flesh has died just like how people died in the Old Testament however we are now kept alive by the Holy Spirit which has now taken the place of our flesh
If there was not the Holy spirit in us we would be dead just like the Old Testament people
### The Walls Of Jericho

Why does God tell people to be quiet?

It is because He is always sitting!
He is enthroned in our praises

But when He asks us to be quiet it is because he is going to stand up!
Be still for the lord is arising out of His habitation
> “Be silent, all flesh, before the Lord, for he has roused himself from his holy dwelling.”
‭‭==Zechariah‬ ‭2‬:‭13‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/zec.2.13.ESV

It took God 30 minutes to stand up in revelations
There is such power in God moving.

Every time God stands there is judgment

> “So the people shouted, and the trumpets were blown. As soon as the people heard the sound of the trumpet, the people shouted a great shout, and the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they captured the city.”
‭‭==Joshua‬ ‭6‬:‭20‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/jos.6.20.ESV

Why did God make them blow trumpets?

Because it makes God remember his promise!

> “And when you go to war in your land against the adversary who oppresses you, then you shall sound an alarm with the trumpets, that you may be remembered before the Lord your God, and you shall be saved from your enemies.”
‭‭==Numbers‬ ‭10‬:‭9‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/num.10.9.ESV

What are our trumpets today?
It’s our praise
Every time they blew trumpets the enemy would get confused and kill each other
When you praise the enemy gets confused and kills each other.

Why does God tell them to shout?
> “Clap your hands, all peoples! Shout to God with loud songs of joy! For the Lord, the Most High, is to be feared, a great king over all the earth. He subdued peoples under us, and nations under our feet. He chose our heritage for us, the pride of Jacob whom he loves. Selah God has gone up with a shout, the Lord with the sound of a trumpet.”
‭‭==Psalm‬ ‭47‬:‭1‬-‭5‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/psa.47.1-5.ESV

When we shout, God is lifted up and shouts through us.

### We are fighting
Joshua is fighting 5 kings and these mirror the things we fight today.

> “So Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem sent to Hoham king of Hebron, to Piram king of Jarmuth, to Japhia king of Lachish, and to Debir king of Eglon, saying, “Come up to me and help me, and let us strike Gibeon. For it has made peace with Joshua and with the people of Israel.””
‭‭==Joshua‬ ‭10‬:‭3‬-‭4‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/jos.10.3-4.ESV

These names all mean the same as what Paul said in Ephesians 6
1. Adoni-Zedek = The prince of the air
2. Hoham = Crusher, powerful crusher
3. Piram = Wild ones
4. Japhia = High ones
5. Debir = Speaker (ones that challenge you with their words)


> “For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers over this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places.”
‭‭==Ephesians‬ ‭6‬:‭12‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/eph.6.12.ESV

We are also fighting these 5 kings
We wrestle not with
1. Flesh and Blood (Demons)
2. Principalities (Chiefs/crushers)
3. Powers (Sargents)
4. Rulers of the darkness of this world (Men possessed by devils
5. Spiritual wickedness in high places (Demon spirits in high places)

We have won against all of these!!!!!!

> “And when they brought those kings out to Joshua, Joshua summoned all the men of Israel and said to the chiefs of the men of war who had gone with him, “Come near; put your feet on the necks of these kings.” Then they came near and put their feet on their necks. And Joshua said to them, “Do not be afraid or dismayed; be strong and courageous. For thus the Lord will do to all your enemies against whom you fight.””
‭‭==Joshua‬ ‭10‬:‭24‬-‭25‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/jos.10.24-25.ESV

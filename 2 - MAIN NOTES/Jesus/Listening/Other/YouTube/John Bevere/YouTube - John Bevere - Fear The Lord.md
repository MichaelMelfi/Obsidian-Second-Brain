# YouTube - John Bevere - Fear The Lord

Fearing the Lord and being scared of the Lord is not the same thing.

  
Being scared or afraid of the Lord means you have things to hide, it means you run away and hide from Him.

Fearing the Lord means you have nothing to hide, you go closer to Him because you fear not having Him and fear being away from God.

  

This is like Adam, when Adam sins and eats the apple he runs and hides away from God.

  

  

  

For example.

If you are driving and have no one looking over you you do not care what speed you’re doing, and don’t care about the rules. However if you know there is a policeman behind you then you make sure everything you do is in the law etc.

  

Same with fearing the lord. 

  

Is almost like having a very deep respect for Hod and his commands.

  

Exodus‬ ‭20‬:‭20‬ ‭NKJV‬‬

“And Moses said to the people, “Do not fear; for God has come to test you, and that His fear may be before you, so that you may not sin.””‬‬

  

How does this work? Surly this contradicts itself?

No, God is not testing to see if you fear him.

He is saying do not be afraid or scared of me but I am testing you to see you to see if my fear is in you.

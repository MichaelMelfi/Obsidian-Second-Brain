##### What Did I Learn From This Teaching?:


# YouTube - Napoleon Hill - God Breaks The Man He Wants To use

Everyone reaches the end of themselves where they cannot take anymore and feel like everything has crushed them.

There is purpose in your pain.
For the man God wants to use, He must first break.

The world teaches to run from pain and hardship and deny the struggle but God is the opposite.

He does not waste pain he uses it, harnesses it and puts your in the refining fire furnace of affliction not in comfort.

If you have walked through a fire or gone through hardship then it might be that heaven has called you to more.
A man who has gone through the valley, tasted sorrow God will bring you out of it and through it, but you have to keep moving, you cannot stop walking.
God does not use the proud, HE resists the proud and uses the broken ones.

Examples in the bible
- Joseph was thrown into a pit, sold into slavery, falsely accused and thrown into prison.
He was broken before he was exalted.

- Moses went from a mighty man to a Shepard, he then wondered the wilderness for 40 years
He was broken of all self sufficiency before he became a deliverer

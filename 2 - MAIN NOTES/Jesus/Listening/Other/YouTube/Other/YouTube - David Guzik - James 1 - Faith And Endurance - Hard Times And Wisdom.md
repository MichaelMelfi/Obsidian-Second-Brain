##### What Did I Learn From This Teaching?:


# YouTube - David Guzik - James 1:1-8 - Faith And Endurance - Hard Times And Wisdom

## James 1:1
### Who is James?

> “James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, To the twelve tribes in the Dispersion: Greetings.”
‭‭==James‬ ‭1‬:‭1‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/jas.1.1.ESV

James Who is writing this is most likely James the Just.
This is Jesus’ half brother
They have the same mother but of course don't have the same father as God is not his father.
James’s father was Joseph.

He lead the church in Jerusalem.

These letters from James are speculated as the first letters written in the New Testament.
About AD46-49

By him saying ‘The Lord Jesus Christ’ this means that James who was the half brother of Jesus knew Jesus was the Christ Lord and that James himself is Jesus’ servant.

# Value of Trials
## James 1:2

> “Count it all joy, my brothers, when you meet trials of various kinds,”
‭‭==James‬ ‭1‬:‭2‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/jas.1.2.ESV

Be joyful when you find yourself in a trial!!
You should not see this as a bad thing but see it as God knowing it is time for you to grow!
You are getting an upgrade!

It is inevitable that you will have trials.
It says “When you meet trials” not “IF you have trials” 
Meaning you will have them.

You will always have occasional testing and or challenges but you must greet it as something God will use and bless in our life.
### What is a trial?
A testing
An affliction
A persecution
An experience where your faith and patience will be stretched.

## James 1:3

> “for you know that the testing of your faith produces steadfastness.”
‭‭==James‬ ‭1‬:‭3‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/jas.1.3.ESV

The word steadfast and or patience in other translations comes from the Greek word Hupomune
Hupomone = Active endurance
This is not a stale patience that you are still and waiting for something to happen.
Hypo = Under
Mone = To stay or adobe or remain
Meaning to stay under
It describes someone who is being held under a weight/load but chooses to stay under the weight and endure the weight/load and keep it held up because they know it will produce steadfastness or patience.
Faith is only tested in the trial, it is not produced in the trial.

> “So faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ.”
‭‭==Romans‬ ‭10‬:‭17‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/rom.10.17.ESV

Faith comes from and is produced from HEARING the Word of God.
Faith is built into us supernaturally as we trust, understand and read into Gods word.

God does not allow trials into our life to breakdown or test our FAITH but rather to expose the faith we already have and create and build up endurance in our life.

## James 1:4

> “And let steadfastness have its full effect, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing.”
‭‭==James‬ ‭1‬:‭4‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/jas.1.4.ESV

#### Ways to decode perfect and complete:

1. These expressions of perfect and complete as they are, come from the Greek Olympic Games.
If you won in the olympics:
You were seen as PERFECT

If you won the decathlon (all 5 races)
You were seen as COMPLETE

It is saying you will come out as a winner just like the Greek olympics.

1. Another way of looking at this is of animal sacrifice.
Before an animal was to be sacrificed the animal would have to be judged as PERFECT and COMPLETE before it could be sacrificed.
This means that if we embrace our trials in faith then God can do a wonderful work in our life in and through those trials.

# Value of Wisdom
## James 1:5

> “If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask God, who gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given him.”
‭‭==James‬ ‭1‬:‭5‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/jas.1.5.ESV

You need wisdom during trials.
Trials bring an opportunity to cry out to God for wisdom that we might not know we need before the trial.

Maybe this is something that God is telling you need to break free from or it is something God is saying you need to perseverance through and come out the other side.
You must have wisdom to discern.

And when we need wisdom, come to God and ask and He will give it to you GENEROUSLY and WITHOUT REPROACH.
He wants to Give us wisdom, but we must want to listen.
It’s that simple!
True wisdom will always be in the Bible.

## James 1:6

> “But let him ask in faith, with no doubting, for the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea that is driven and tossed by the wind.”
‭‭==James‬ ‭1‬:‭6‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/jas.1.6.ESV

When you ask for Wisdom, you must ask it as if you are asking anything.
It must be with faith.
That you know without doubting that God actually wants to give you the wisdom and can.

WITH NO DOUBTING
A wave of the sea can be someone who is hindered by someone who is doubting and is without rest but like waves.
Waves change depending on how much wind there is around it and what is happening on the earth.
It is dictated by its surroundings.

It is unstable as you do not know when it will come crashing down.

A wave can be used for great destruction and so is someone who doubts.
We must be firm with what we believe.
No matter what the surrounding situation is, we stand firm and let God dictate our next move.
## James 1:7

> “For that person must not suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord;”
‭‭==James‬ ‭1‬:‭7‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/jas.1.7.ESV

## James 1:8

> “he is a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways.”
‭‭==James‬ ‭1‬:‭8‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/jas.1.8.ESV

What is double minded?
If you ask God for something in a doubting way you are double minded
To ask God to do anything, you have to have some faith
If you have no faith you would not ask God anything at all.

If you had no unbelief then you would have no doubting in God.

You are in a middle ground of faith and unbelief is to be double minded.

A double minded person is someone who lives in the middle.
They cannot let go of the world but do not want to let go of God.

This is the same as being Luke warm

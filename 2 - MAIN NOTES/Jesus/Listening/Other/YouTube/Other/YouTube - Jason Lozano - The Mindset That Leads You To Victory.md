##### What Did I Learn From This Teaching?:
- It is not your heart that causes change, it is your mind.
- Your heart can be in love with God but it is in your mind where the battles happen.
- YOU MUST RENEW YOUR MIND
- Your mind is where change comes from
- Meditation is where you become strong and courageous.
- Take every thought captive and command it to bow to the Word of God
- Meditate day and night!
- You cannot hear from God in bondage
- What is your first response? (Davids was bring me my ephod)
Is yours bring me my bible?
- With God you can do anything even if everyone around you is saying the opposite

# YouTube - Jason Lozano - The Mindset That Leads You To Victory - Strongholds

## What Is A Strong hold?
Strongholds are sometimes amazing or horrible things
If strongholds are not dealt with even if you love Jesus with all your heart, it can hold you back.
‘As a man thinks so he will become’

Outside of Gods words which is His power, people do not change.
Unless you love the Lord with your mind, it means nothing and there will be no change.

People love God with their heart but this is why you need the mind because that is where the battle ground is.
This is why you see people at church loving God but they are the same people you see at the clubs etc because they aren’t constantly renewing their mind.

If you do not love God with your mind then that is why you keep going round in circles going back and forth between sin and freedom.
You have to constantly renew your mind!
We have to put in the work.

> “For the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh but have divine power to destroy strongholds. We destroy arguments and every lofty opinion raised against the knowledge of God, and take every thought captive to obey Christ,”
==‭‭2 Corinthians‬ ‭10‬:‭4‬-‭5‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/2co.10.5.ESV

We must take every thought captive.
God has done everythingHe needs to do in our lives.
It is our duty to renew and put in the work to keep going forward.

This is a lot of work - it says EVERY THOUGHT - not just some.

IM TAKING EVERY THOUGHT CAPTIVE
Every form of fear
Insecurity
Intimidation
Fear
Worry
Doubt
Hate
Lust
And command them to obey Jesus Christ which what He says about my life and everything in it and around it.
everything i think will submit to God

## Building two strong holds
1. Strength
2. Prosperity

> “Beloved, I pray that all may go well with you and that you may be in good health, as it goes well with your soul.”
‭‭==3 John‬ ‭1‬:‭2‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/3jn.1.2.ESV

God wants you healthy and prospered in every area in your life.
But you’ve got to change your mind.
Being prospered means going forward.
WE ARE GOING FORWARD

> “Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the wicked, nor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of scoffers; but his delight is in the law of the Lord, and on his law he meditates day and night.”
‭‭==Psalm‬ ‭1‬:‭1‬-‭2‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/psa.1.2.ESV

> “He is like a tree planted by streams of water that yields its fruit in its season, and its leaf does not wither. In all that he does, he prospers. The wicked are not so, but are like chaff that the wind drives away.”
‭‭==Psalm‬ ‭1‬:‭3‬-‭4‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/psa.1.3-4.ESV

We are moving to the higher call
We do not know what higher looks like
It is way higher than you can even imagine.
We are going to another level!

> “This Book of the Law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do according to all that is written in it. For then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have good success.”
‭‭==Joshua‬ ‭1‬:‭8‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/jos.1.8.ESV

You must put in the work!
Day and night
if you only work in the natural world you will only prosper in the natural world.
You have got to work on your spirit and connection to God to grow in the spirit world.

Mediate - means to moan, utter, growl, speak softly to oneself, muse until the Word becomes a source of inspiration
You cannot just cast down a negative thought with a positive thought; it must be cast down with the spoken Word of God.
All Scripture is God breathed, it is living and active, sharper than any 2 edged sword.
USE IT AND MEDITATE ON IT DAY AND NIGHT

God never mentioned the enemy, the giant or the opposition.
In mans eyes they can only see the physical giants but all God is worried about it the giant in between their eyes. Their MIND.
He knew that they had to break their own strongholds in the mind.

> “Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do not be frightened, and do not be dismayed, for the Lord your God is with you wherever you go.””
‭‭==Joshua‬ ‭1‬:‭9‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/jos.1.9.ESV

One you sort out your mind then you will be courageous and strong!
You can not be frightened

There is no giant in the bible that won against God people.
David went against a giant that everyone said there was no chance against, and he took that giants head clean off.
David was the only one with a renewed mind.

Read the bible and it will inspire you to be everything God has called you to be.
Strong, Courageous, established, firm, obstinately, mighty, fortified, stubborn with the word of God, building new strongholds of strength and prosperity.

What is telling you, you are not able?
You are more than able with God.

Have i not COMMANDED YOU.
It is a command, not an option.

If you meditate, you will be strong and courageous and cannot be defeated.

> “And David was greatly distressed, for the people spoke of stoning him, because all the people were bitter in soul, each for his sons and daughters. But David strengthened himself in the Lord his God. And David said to Abiathar the priest, the son of Ahimelech, “Bring me the ephod.” So Abiathar brought the ephod to David.”
==‭‭1 Samuel‬ ‭30‬:‭6‬-‭7‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/1sa.30.6-7.ESV

He didn’t need anyone to strengthen him, he strengthened himself.
He was all alone, everyone wanted to kill him.

You cannot hear from God in bondage.

He meditated on God and came out a warrior with a mission.
He renewed his mind.

What do you say?
When something  bad happens, what is your first response?
Bring me my tissues or bring me my bible.

Give God you’re everything, your eyes, heart, ears, hands, feet, mouth

We must love God with everything, not just a heart.
Money, body, mind, will, emotions, friends, family.

You have to love God the whole way through the fight.

Sometimes there are football games that in the last 5 minutes the loosing team shows up and wins.
In boxing the last 2 rounds are called championship rounds because that is where the champion is chosen and crowned.
Keep fighting your fight, do not give up.
The ending is more important than the start.
Some of you will think that you messed up at the beginning, or God can’t use you because of things you have done in the past, but you’re not at the end yet, keep fighting, keep pressing forward, keep getting up and dont back down. You aren’t at the end of your fight yet.

Jesus rose from the dead so you can keep on fighting!
You have been set free of captivity.
You have to go to pharo and say LET MY PEOPLE GO, we are getting out of this.

I dont care where you start, there is nothing that the enemy can do to stop you!
David went against everything, everyone, and God took him from the backside of nowhere, a little Shepard boy and raised him to the highest place in the nation.

David stood in front of Goliath. 17 YEARS OLD, your age does not matter
David says ‘Who do you think you are’
Goliath was offended and asked the same thing back but David said
With guts and growl ‘nonono you answer my question, who do you think you are you uncircumcised philastine, how dare you come to our camp and mock MY GOD’
David then ran towards Goliath.

Where did he get this strength??
He was a meditator
The Lord is My strength
The Lord is My refuge 
The Lord is My Strong tower
The Lord is My Trained my hand
The Lord is My strong battle axe 

There is nothing anyone can do against you if you meditate in the word day and night!

Some people have been left for dead but God is your resurrector

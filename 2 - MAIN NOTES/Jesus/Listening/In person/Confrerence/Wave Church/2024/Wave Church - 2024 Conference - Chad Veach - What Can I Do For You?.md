# Wave Church - Conference - Chad Veach - What Can I Do For You?
“For as we have many members in one body, but all the members do not have the same function, so we, being many, are one body in Christ, and individually members of one another. Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, let us use them: if prophecy, let us prophesy in proportion to our faith; or ministry, let us use it in our ministering; he who teaches, in teaching; he who exhorts, in exhortation; he who gives, with liberality; he who leads, with diligence; he who shows mercy, with cheerfulness.”

‭‭Romans‬ ‭12‬:‭4‬-‭8‬ ‭NKJV‬‬

  

“In this way we are like the various parts of a human body. Each part gets its meaning from the body as a whole, not the other way around. The body we’re talking about is Christ’s body of chosen people. Each of us finds our meaning and function as a part of his body. But as a chopped-off finger or cut-off toe we wouldn’t amount to much, would we? So since we find ourselves fashioned into all these excellently formed and marvelously functioning parts in Christ’s body, let’s just go ahead and be what we were made to be, without enviously or pridefully comparing ourselves with each other, or trying to be something we aren’t. If you preach, just preach God’s Message, nothing else; if you help, just help, don’t take over; if you teach, stick to your teaching; if you give encouraging guidance, be careful that you don’t get bossy; if you’re put in charge, don’t manipulate; if you’re called to give aid to people in distress, keep your eyes open and be quick to respond; if you work with the disadvantaged, don’t let yourself get irritated with them or depressed by them. Keep a smile on your face. * * * Love from the center of who you are; don’t fake it. Run for dear life from evil; hold on for dear life to good. Be good friends who love deeply; practice playing second fiddle.”

‭‭Romans‬ ‭12‬:‭4‬-‭10‬ ‭MSG‬‬

  

  

Be who you were made to be, don’t try and be someone else.

Be who God made YOU to be.

  

Don’t fall in love with your gift, fall in love with your gift giver!

  

Both of the below are examples of people being too in love with their gift.

  

“Now all of this happened to King Nebuchadnezzar. After twelve months, he happened to be walking around on the battlements of the royal palace of Babylon. The king uttered these words: “Is this not the great Babylon that I have built for a royal residence by my own mighty strength and for my majestic honor?””

‭‭Daniel‬ ‭4‬:‭28‬-‭30‬ ‭NET‬‬

  

““Son of man, sing a lament for the king of Tyre, and say to him, ‘This is what the sovereign Lord says: “‘You were the sealer of perfection, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty. You were in Eden, the garden of God. Every precious stone was your covering, the ruby, topaz, and emerald, the chrysolite, onyx, and jasper, the sapphire, turquoise, and beryl; your settings and mounts were made of gold. On the day you were created they were prepared.”

‭‭Ezekiel‬ ‭28‬:‭12‬-‭13‬ ‭NET‬‬

  

I am more impressed with the gift giver not the person with the gift.

  

  

God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble.

HOW HUMBLE CAN I GO?

  

Pride is the only sin where the people around you suffer and not you.

  

  

Your gift and Gods mission go hand in hand

  

1. The analogy of a basketball in my hands is worth £10 but in labrons hands it’s for £200million 
2. A rod in my hands is just a rod but a rod in Moses hands can part a sea.
3. Same with 5 lives and 2 fish.
4. Same with Daniel and the sling shot

  

When you partner with God it transforms whatever you have from a small business to something that multiplies.

  

  

Ask not what god can do for you…ask what you can do for God

  

“When a certain immoral woman from that city heard he was eating there, she brought a beautiful alabaster jar filled with expensive perfume. Then she knelt behind him at his feet, weeping. Her tears fell on his feet, and she wiped them off with her hair. Then she kept kissing his feet and putting perfume on them.”

‭‭Luke‬ ‭7‬:‭37‬-‭38‬ ‭NLT‬‬

  

  

Free yourself from comparison and jealousy

  

When I get to heaven I’m responsible for myself not someone else or other people.

As I am only accountable for me not you

  

  

God used people who had problems!

# Wave Church - 2024 Conference - Charlotte Gambill - Posture Familiarity
Just like a cyropractor that sorts out your posture that has been skewed over time from things you have been doing that ruins your posture. God will sort your posture that has been ruined over time from things you have been doing every day.

  

Sometimes you might not even know you have a bad posture.

  

Your posture will pass down to the people below you and will soon enough become the norm.

Make sure your posture is right.

  

TAKE OFF YOUR SHOES

  

Exodus 3:1-6

“Take off your sandals for this is holy ground”

  

Shoes can give you fake height

Shoes can stop bad oder 

Shoes can cover up something ugly that we have tended to.

  

This is the same as the Spirit.

  

  

LUKE 4:16-30

Everyone was AMAZED and applauding Jesus but because one person said “isn’t this not Joseph’s son”

And because that one person said that, Jesus could not do anything because even though they were excited about him being there there was a posture of the people that was not right and accepting of him.

  

They became too over familiar with Jesus that he was no able to do anything.

  

Where can you sort out your posture?

  

The house of God

This was at his own Home and the posture of His home people was wrong!

  

The church is not your house it is Gods house! 

Stop treating church as if it is your house where you become over familiar and always remember it is Gods house.

  

If you become over familiar in the band you will come entertainers instead of carrying and ministering the anointing.

  

If you become over familiar then you will stop looking for new things and become lazy and complacent.

  

When treating things in the house you forget when you are handling thousands of pounds worth of equipment and forgetting that it’s someone’s tithe.

  

  

In the Family

  

It was Jesus own people who because over familiar with Him.

  

When you become over familiar you make church karaoke.

  

  

Damaging the future

When you are a Christian you carry the presents of God.

  

2 Samuel 6

  

How can the ark be connected to both but have opposite impacts?

Abinidab was proud and complacent and said he could do everything himself.

  

Obededom respected the Ark/ Gods presence, he didn’t ask for it he didn’t even know he was getting it, he just had the right honour and posture.

  

People have died from being in the presence of God

WE CARRY IT IN OURSELVES

OUT BODY US LITERALLY THE TEMPLE OF THE HOLY SPIRIT

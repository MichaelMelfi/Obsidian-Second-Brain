# Wave Church - 2024 Conference - Steve Kelly - 10 Things I Would Tell My Younger Self
Psalm 71:18

Now also when I am old and grayheaded,

O God, do not forsake me,

Until I declare Your strength to this generation,

Your power to everyone who is to come.

  

  

Longevity matters more than the moment

  

Be upfront with people because if you are not the longevity of the situation could be worse.

  

  

  

Don’t let your loyalty put you in a bondage to gods calling to something new

  

Don’t make your loyalty to something stop you from being all God has called you to do.

  

  

Game face matters

  

People should never know you are having a bad time. There should be people you can talk too but you need to be the leader that is strong for your followers and always be able and be ready to bare fruit.

  

  

People skills matter

  

How good are you with people? Not just preaching

  

Don’t take everything personally

  

Don’t loose your sense of humour

  

If you love people, they will put up with your mistake if they know you love them

  

When you walk into a room, ask the Holy Spirit who he wants you to talk to.

  

  

Character matters more than giftedness

  

Don’t let someone’s giftedness make you blind to a bad character

  

  

Don’t compare

  

You are gifted and called to your specific thing, you cannot be someone else, you cannot be as good at being someone else than they are at being themselves or you will always fall short.

  

  

Being kind is more important than being right

  

  

  

You’ve gotta stop and smell the roses

  

You’ve gotta stop and celebrate things, you cannot go from mountain to mountain to mountain. You’ve got to enjoy your current season as you cannot rush what God has sorted for you.

  

  

Self leadership is vital

  

You have to be able to lead yourself

If you cannot lead yourself you cannot lead other people.

In finances, discipline, time

  

  

Don’t get stuck in a chapter

  

You’ve got to look at yourself if nothing is moving.

  

  

Hate legalism

  

Get help when help is needed

  

You cannot do everything yourself, you might have a calling to something but you must have people supporting you and keeping you on track.

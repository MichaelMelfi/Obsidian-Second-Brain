Growth can mask a lack of health but health WILL grow your church

  

  

Galatians 6:9

And let us not grow weary while doing good, for in due season we shall reap if we do not lose heart.

  

Matthew 13

|The Parable of the Mustard Seed<br><br>([Mark 4:30-32](blb://pericope/nkjv/Mark%204:30-32); [Luke 13:18, 19](blb://pericope/nkjv/Luke%2013:18-19) )<br><br>31 ¶ Another parable He put forth to them, saying: “The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field,|
|32 “which indeed is the least of all the seeds; but when it is grown it is greater than the herbs and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and nest in its branches.”|

  

  

  

TIME IS MY ADVANTAGE

  

Your dreams do not stop with you

You should be building something that lasts for generations not something that ends when you finish

  

If your dreams and visions end with you then they were too small!

  

Great dreams take time to grow just like trees

What you cannot see is the trees roots that support and feed the tree that are usually as big as what’s above the surface and what its feedings/supporting

  

Joseph had pain and turmoil before he had the dream and him the influence he became!

  

  

If I live right consistently then time will be my advantage

  

When my roots are deep in God I can grow through any environment.

  

If God has called you to something then time is your weapon, if you stay planeted then God will produce and build something spectacular.

  

  

How to keep stepping into health in church

  

1. Discipline

Staying disciplined in the things that matter like the Bible, the word, preaches, books, relationships

Fights against the mentality of you need more to be more or see more.

Comfortable with the process

  

How would I live if I didn’t have to impress anyone or prove anything?

If we believe what God has said about us then we do not need to impress or prove anything to anyone.

  

  

1. Consistency

“And let us not grow weary while doing good, for in due season we shall reap if we do not lose heart.”

‭‭Galatians‬ ‭6‬:‭9‬ ‭NKJV‬‬

  

 When you are consistent then the things that matter become more and more just who you are every day.

  

Consistency builds trust and the more trust we have the more we can do and less we have to watch over people.

  

  

1. Honest AND optimistic

  

“Build houses and dwell in them; plant gardens and eat their fruit. Take wives and beget sons and daughters; and take wives for your sons and give your daughters to husbands, so that they may bear sons and daughters—that you may be increased there, and not diminished. And seek the peace of the city where I have caused you to be carried away captive, and pray to the Lord for it; for in its peace you will have peace. For thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Do not let your prophets and your diviners who are in your midst deceive you, nor listen to your dreams which you cause to be dreamed. For they prophesy falsely to you in My name; I have not sent them, says the Lord. For thus says the Lord: After seventy years are completed at Babylon, I will visit you and perform My good word toward you, and cause you to return to this place.”

‭‭Jeremiah‬ ‭29‬:‭5‬-‭10‬ ‭NKJV‬‬

  

We are not just trying to survive we are trying to progress and build!

# Wave Church - 2024 Conference - Chad Veach - What The Church Needs Now
Culture Carriers

Culture is not what we say but what we do

Culture is caught by being around you

Culture trumps everything

  

2 Samuel 17:8

“For,” said Hushai, “you know your father and his men, that they are mighty men, and they are enraged in their minds, like a bear robbed of her cubs in the field; and your father is a man of war, and will not camp with the people.

  

  

  

House protectors

2 Samuel 3:1

 ¶ Now there was a long war between the house of Saul and the house of David. But David grew stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul grew weaker and weaker.

  

You must protect your anointing and your calling

  

How many times do we sacrifice talent over character.

  

We must protect the integrity of the house.

  

The little foxes spoil the whole vineyard

  

  

  

Bible readers

2 Timothy 3:6-17

  

You do not study the bible, the bible will study you.

  

The word of the Lord is alive and well, sharper than any two edged sword.

  

How can you let rivers of flowing water come out of you into other people if it never firstly goes into you.

  

I read the bible for ME not for a message.

  

  

Tithers

  

Malachi 3:10

Bring all the tithes into the storehouse,

That there may be food in My house,

And try Me now in this,”

Says the LORD of hosts,

“If I will not open for you the windows of heaven

And pour out for you such blessing

That there will not be room enough to receive it.

  

We want tithers not tippers!

  

You cannot have offerings if you do not first have tithers.

  

God can do more with 90% of your money if it is blessed (tithed) than 100% of your money unblessed (untithed)

  

  

Unity builders

  

Psalms 33:1-2

|   |
|---|
|1 ¶ A Song of Ascents. Of David.<br><br>  <br><br>Behold, how good and how pleasant it is<br><br>For brethren to dwell together in unity!|
|2 It is like the precious oil upon the head,<br><br>Running down on the beard,<br><br>The beard of Aaron,<br><br>Running down on the edge of his garments.|

  

  

Sunday occupiers

Focus on Sunday not just the behind the scenes!

Everything comes from the church so put your focus on that and everything flows from the strength of the church.

  

  

  

Big requesters

If you want to follow Jesus there will be a cost.

  

If you want to gain life then you will have to loose your life.

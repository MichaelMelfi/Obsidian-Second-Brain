Phil Dooley - Hillsong pastor

  

  

Paul

When something happens, it is more important with how you respond rather than how you react because if you respond to what is happening then you miracles are already happening through what you do.

  

Do not wait until you’re ready to leave or move on but wait until your next leader is ready. Whether that’s earlier or later than expected you want it to be.

  

I would not change what I’ve been through because I know God trusted me with it for a greater purpose but I would not wish what I’ve been through on anyone.

  

Don’t have faith for a miracle, but have faith in God and believe the miracle will come true.

  

  

Phil

Pastors are shepards

Shepards do not go where it’s good for the Shepard but where is it good for the sheep and where can feed the most and grow the most.

  

Taking the high road is saying you trust God with what’s happening.

It is like having a gun with unlimited bullets and not firing any so you don’t damage others.

  

You take the low road just to show your worth and you feel like you have to prove something.

  

Gods measurement is different to ours - His is SPIRIT not SIZE

Hope is the birthplace of faith

  

God does not create bad things but God allows things to happen to build you to become greater.

  

What is the current level of your hope through the situation you are in and what God wants you to go into to.

  

The Devil does things to make you fail but God Intrusts you to go through those things because when you get through it, the testimony will be so great is will undo and destroy anything the devil had.

  

Daniel 11:32

“Those who do wickedly against the covenant he shall corrupt with flattery; but the people who know their God shall be strong, and carry out great exploits.”

  

Your responsibility is hope and God gives you the faith.

  

Can you believe that you can do anything through Christ?

  

We might know we can do it through scripture but there is a difference between knowing it and believing it.

  

If you can hope through the battles you are going through then you will not see the fruit afterwards.

  

It’s not about what we achieve but about what God can do through the achievements.

  

A revelation is something that no matter what happens or how hard it gets you never loose sight and veer off course. you know that as long as you are on the earth God will not let you go before it is completed.

|The God-Given Task<br><br>9 ¶ What profit has the worker from that in which he labors?|
|10 I have seen the God-given task with which the sons of men are to be occupied.|
|11 He has made everything beautiful in its time. Also He has put eternity in their hearts, except that no one can find out the work that God does from beginning to end.|
|12 ¶ I know that nothing is better for them than to rejoice, and to do good in their lives,|
|13 and also that every man should eat and drink and enjoy the good of all his labor—it isthe gift of God.|

  

We work from now forward and God works from eternity past and future back

  

God has made everything beautiful in its time. it might just not be its time yet!!!

  

Outcomes and secondary to purpose. You focus on the purpose you are doing a thing not the outcome of what will happen.

  

  

Breakthrough requires resilience

  

James 2:14

What does it profit, my brethren, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Can faith save him?

  

Can your faith save you?

  

Your level of faith has to match your level of commitment

  

  

What is my revelation?

  

James 2:17

Thus also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.

  

What am I doing to make my faith come true?

  

  

  

  

Leaders are forerunners

  

Mark 1:1-2

|   |
|---|
|1 ¶ The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.|
|2 As it is written in the Prophets:fn<br><br>  <br><br>“Behold, I send My messenger before Your face,<br><br>Who will prepare Your way before You.”|

This is like leaders as you are the messenger who goes before everyone else.

  

Even Jesus has a forerunner and that was John the baptiser.

  

Mark 1:3-4

|   |

|3 “The voice of one crying in the wilderness:<br><br>‘Prepare the way of the LORD;<br><br>Make His paths straight.’ ”fn|
|4 ¶ John came baptizing in the wilderness and preaching a baptism of repentance for the remission of sins.|

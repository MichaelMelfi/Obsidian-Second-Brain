# Citygate Church - Julian Melfi - THE HUNDRED FOLD RETURN - 2 The Hundred Fold Return
The same parable is in 3 out of the 4 gospels

  

Matthew 13:8

“Still other seeds fell on fertile soil, and they produced a crop that was thirty, sixty, and even a hundred times as much as had been planted!”

‭‭

Mark 4:20

“And the seed that fell on good soil represents those who hear and accept God’s word and produce a harvest of thirty, sixty, or even a hundred times as much as had been planted!””

‭‭

Luke 8:15

“And the seeds that fell on the good soil represent honest, good-hearted people who hear God’s word, cling to it, and patiently produce a huge harvest.”

‭‭

Because all three versions are said in different ways this is a mix of all 3

- The harvest is not determined on the seed but is determined on the receiver

This means that whatever God sows into our lives 100% of the time has the capacity to return 100 fold

  

  

- 100 fold does not only mean 100 x that thing

100 fold in the bible is the number of maximum so this means the absolute maximum possibility for that seed.

  

  

  

Mark 4:21-25

“A little farther up the shore he saw two other brothers, James and John, sitting in a boat with their father, Zebedee, repairing their nets. And he called them to come, too. They immediately followed him, leaving the boat and their father behind. Jesus traveled throughout the region of Galilee, teaching in the synagogues and announcing the Good News about the Kingdom. And he healed every kind of disease and illness. News about him spread as far as Syria, and people soon began bringing to him all who were sick. And whatever their sickness or disease, or if they were demon possessed or epileptic or paralyzed—he healed them all. Large crowds followed him wherever he went—people from Galilee, the Ten Towns, Jerusalem, from all over Judea, and from east of the Jordan River.

  

You are the one who limits your harvest.

  

(Pastor has added in the words knowledge and harvest)

Some things are hidden

Some things you need to dig for.

  

God hasn’t said things easily and plane in the bible because He wants us to value what we find.

If we get it easily we do not value what we find.

  

They aren’t hidden from you, they are hidden for you.

  

  

  

What is not producing in my life?

Where am I getting my 30 fold and not 100 fold?

  

Because we don’t settle for anything other than the 100 fold

  

  

  

Identify the lamp stand in your life

The lamp stand is an influencer

Because a lamp lights the whole house.

  

What is the loudest voice in the house?

The lamp is the influencer that fills your house and makes decisions for you

  

Money?

Entertainment?

Social media?

A person?

  

You must identify this because if it is not God then you will not get the 100 fold return

  

  

  

Elevate Gods word to the highest place of influence

  

This must be the center of your life

This must be your lamp stand

  

Put the word of God where it needs to be

Get it out from under the best and put it on the table

  

  

  

Revelations brings Gods best

Declare the best always

You will get the 100 fold, do not limit what god can do by saying you can’t do something

  

It’s not just about me but about other people. We are blessed to be a blessing.

You must help other people put the word of God

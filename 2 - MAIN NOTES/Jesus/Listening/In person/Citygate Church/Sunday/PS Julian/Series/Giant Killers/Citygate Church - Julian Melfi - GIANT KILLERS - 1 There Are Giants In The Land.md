|Spies Sent into Canaan<br><br>([Deut. 1:19-33](blb://pericope/nkjv/Deut.%201:19-33) )<br><br>1 ¶ And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,||
|2 “Send men to spy out the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the children of Israel; from each tribe of their fathers you shall send a man, every one a leader among them.”||

|   |   |
|---|---|
|16 ¶ These are the names of the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land. And Moses called Hosheafn the son of Nun, Joshua.|God changed his name.|
|17 ¶ Then Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said to them, “Go up this wayinto the South, and go up to the mountains,||
|18 “and see what the land is like: whether the people who dwell in it are strong or weak, few or many;||

When there is a name change in the bible it is because they need to have a fresh start with their life as they are going into a new season!

  

We speak pray etc in the name of Jesus.

This is because when we get born again we get a new name Jesus as we are now part of the Christ.

So when you pray in the name of Jesus is it if Jesus is praying!

When you are praying you are praying as if Jesus is praying as Jesus is your new name!

|19 “whether the land they dwell in is good or bad; whether the cities they inhabit are like camps or strongholds;||
|20 “whether the land is rich or poor; and whether there are forests there or not. Be of good courage. And bring some of the fruit of the land.” Now the time was the season of the first ripe grapes.|BE ENCOURAGED no matter what you are going through or what has happened, BE ENCOURAGED as God has gone before you. You have not seen anything yet, fruitfulness is abundant.|

|27 Then they told him, and said: “We went to the land where you sent us. It truly flows with milk and honey, and this is its fruit.||
|28 “Nevertheless the people who dwell in the land arestrong; the cities are fortified and very large; moreover we saw the descendants of Anak there.|It was all going well until they went against what God said. they brought in their thoughts and humanness so went away from what God said.|
|29 “The Amalekites dwell in the land of the South; the Hittites, the Jebusites, and the Amorites dwell in the mountains; and the Canaanites dwell by the sea and along the banks of the Jordan.”||

|30 ¶ Then Caleb quieted the people before Moses, and said, “Let us go up at once and take possession, for we are well able to overcome it.”|Caleb means DOG in Hebrew. But it is not a small dog it is a big dog that when it bites it doesn’t let go. If the ground shakes it will stand strong. Sometimes you have to shut everyone up and say that no matter what is before you and what people are saying; I AM WELL ABLE TO OVER COME IT. Sometimes you are the only one standing your ground, there were 2 people saying they can do it and 3MILLION saying they can’t do it.|
|31 ¶ But the men who had gone up with him said, “We are not able to go up against the people, for they are stronger than we.”||
|32 And they gave the children of Israel a bad report of the land which they had spied out, saying, “The land through which we have gone as spies is a land that devours its inhabitants, and all the people whom we saw in it are men of greatstature.||

|Israel Refuses to Enter Canaan<br><br>1 ¶ So all the congregation lifted up their voices and cried, and the people wept that night.||
|2 And all the children of Israel complained against Moses and Aaron, and the whole congregation said to them, “If only we had died in the land of Egypt! Or if only we had died in this wilderness!||
|3 “Why has the LORD brought us to this land to fall by the sword, that our wives and children should become victims? Would it not be better for us to return to Egypt?”||

|8 “If the LORD delights in us, then He will bring us into this land and give it to us, ‘a land which flows with milk and honey.’fn|they keep going back to what God said! You have to stand on what has said and keep going back to it.|
|9 “Only do not rebel against the LORD, nor fear the people of the land, for they are our bread; their protection has departed from them, and the LORD is with us. Do not fear them.”||
|10 ¶ And all the congregation said to stone them with stones. Now the glory of the LORDappeared in the tabernacle of meeting before all the children of Israel.||

|Moses Intercedes for the People||
|11 ¶ Then the LORD said to Moses: “How long will these people reject Me? And how long will they not believe Me, with all the signs which I have performed among them?||

  

The number 40 means it’s a test.

40 years with Moses.

40 days Jesus was tested by the devil.

  

See what is coming

- We must see what’s coming so we are ready for it.
- God sent spies into the land so they can be prepared and see what is coming and what they are coming against.
- He didn’t want them to intimidated but he wanted them to keep standing on the WORD Gods given to you.

  

  

Life is a test

- You must be equipped to pass the test.
- God said to send the spies because it was a test to see if they stood strong or not.
- All of the tests that are infront of you can overcome, God does not set you up for a failure.

  

  

There are giants in the land

- The giants are there so we can know how to defeat them.
- David was given a bear so then he could kill the lion so then he could kill Goliath so then he could set a nation free. If there was the bear or lion in the first place he wouldn’t have been prepared and ready to kill Goliath.

  

  

Pass the test

- We are well able to pass anything before us.
- We will believe the GOOD REPORT.
- We don’t just get given the report but we come up with the GOOD REPORT.

  

  

Whose report will I declare

- I will declare the land is abundant, beautiful, overflowing, sweat.

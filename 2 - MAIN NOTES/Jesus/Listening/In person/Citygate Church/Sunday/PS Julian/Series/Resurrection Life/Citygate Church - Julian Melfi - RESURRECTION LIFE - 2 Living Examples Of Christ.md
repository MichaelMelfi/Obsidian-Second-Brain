# Citygate Church - Julian Melfi - RESURRECTION LIFE - 2 Living Examples Of Christ
Collosians 3 : 1-17

  

|   |   |
|---|---|
|1 ¶ If then you were raised with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ is, sitting at the right hand of God.||
|2 Set your mind on things above, not on things on the earth.||
|3 For you died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.||
|4 When Christ who is our life appears, then you also will appear with Him in glory.||
|5 ¶ Therefore put to death your members which are on the earth: fornication, uncleanness, passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry.||
|6 Because of these things the wrath of God is coming upon the sons of disobedience,||
|7 in which you yourselves once walked when you lived in them.||
|8 ¶ But now you yourselves are to put off all these: anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy language out of your mouth.||
|9 Do not lie to one another, since you have put off the old man with his deeds,||
|10 and have put on the new man who is renewed in knowledge according to the image of Him who created him,||
|11 where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcised nor uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave nor free, but Christ is all and in all.||
|Character of the New Man<br><br>12 ¶ Therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, put on tender mercies, kindness, humility, meekness, longsuffering;||
|13 bearing with one another, and forgiving one another, if anyone has a complaint against another; even as Christ forgave you, so you also must do.|The answer to someone’s complaint is to forgive them first. Not wait for them to do right|
|14 But above all these things put on love, which is the bond of perfection.||
|15 And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to which also you were called in one body; and be thankful.||
|16 Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.||
|17 And whatever you do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through Him.||

Our lives are an open book, what are people seeing when they look at me?

  

DO NOT BE ASHAMED OF JESUS, when people read your life it should have Jesus all over it.

It should say joy, forgiveness, faithfulness etc

  

Religion says you must get joy etc

Christianity says Jesus who is all of those things lives in you so you already have joy etc in you when you get baptised, you just have to let him out.

  

- 1, We are to be salt and light

|   |   |
|---|---|
|13 ¶ “You are the salt of the earth; but if the salt loses its flavor, how shall it be seasoned? It is then good for nothing but to be thrown out and trampled underfoot by men.|People are crying out for a new flavour and we have the salt/spice that they need. JESUS.|
|14 ¶ “You are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hidden.|People need us to be open for everyone to read. God is not a secret|
|15 “Nor do they light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a lampstand, and it gives light to all who are in the house.||
|16 “Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven.||

  

We are either a thermostats or a thermometer.

  

A thermostat sets the heat or coolness of the house.

  

A thermometer reacts to the heat or coolness of the house.

  

If you are a thermostat, when you enter a room, the other people have to rise to your faith, joy and Christianity.

  

If you are a thermometer, you react and rise/lower to the level of what the room is.

If other people are swearing you start swearing, when everyone does drugs/drinks you do it as-well.

  

  

  

- 2, The stark contrast

  

There is no similarity what so ever between us and the world

Jesus said, You are either in the world or out of it there is no one the fence.

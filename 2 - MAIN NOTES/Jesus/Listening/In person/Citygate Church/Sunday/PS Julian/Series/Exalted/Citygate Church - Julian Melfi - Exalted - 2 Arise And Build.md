# Citygate Church - Julian Melfi - Exalted - 2 Arise And Build
ARISE AND BUILD 2

  

The church work hand in hand with God to build and grow the church.

  

Nehemiah 2:18-20

|   |
|---|
|18 And I told them of the hand of my God which had been good upon me, and also of the king’s words that he had spoken to me. So they said, “Let us rise up and build.” Then they set their hands to thisgood work.|
|19 ¶ But when Sanballat the Horonite, Tobiah the Ammonite official, and Geshem the Arab heard of it,they laughed at us and despised us, and said, “What is this thing that you are doing? Will you rebel against the king?”|
|20 ¶ So I answered them, and said to them, “The God of heaven Himself will prosper us; therefore we His servants will arise and build, but you have no heritage or right or memorial in Jerusalem.|

  

We believe your words have power. What you say shall come to pass.

  

We believe that our tongue is the rudder of our life.

  

But you cannot just speak, you must do and PUT YOUR HANDS TO WORK. It is not our efforts that get the victory it is the power of God.

  

If you get your eyes off the target you become discouraged and frustrated.

If you discourage or frustrate someone or yourself it is like you are employed by the devil to stop where their or your sights are by trying to bring them down to reality/the worldly view.

  

Jesus said he will give you all things.

God will do far abundantly more than you can think or ask.

  

Get off your horizontal self and arise and build and create momentum.

  

Once a car starts moving it rolls it’s self but the first push is the hardest.

  

Sometimes we are so fixated on fixing or telling other people what to do but it’s actually ourselves that need to freshen up more than them.

  

Haggai 2:2-4

|   |
|---|
|The Coming Glory of God’s House<br><br>1 ¶ In the seventh month, on the twenty-first of the month, the word of the LORD came by Haggai the prophet, saying:|
|2 “Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and to the remnant of the people, saying:|
|3 ‘Who is left among you who saw this templefn in its former glory? And how do you see it now? In comparison with it, is this not in your eyes as nothing?|
|4 ‘Yet now be strong, Zerubbabel,’ says the LORD; ‘and be strong, Joshua, son of Jehozadak, the high priest; and be strong, all you people of the land,’ says the LORD, ‘and work; for I am with you,’ says the LORD of hosts|

  

If you keep on thinking backwards, you will never move forward.

If you keep looking in your wing mirror and not focus where you’re driving towards you will go off corse and crash.

  

It’s not just about speaking and doing. It’s also about hearing what God wants you to do.

  

1. Moving forwards will take STRENGTH

Never say I am weak. Say I AM STRONG IN THE LORD AND HIS MIGHT.

“The joy of the lord is my STRENGTH”

You have to have STRENGTH to finish the job

  

1. Moving forwards will take AWARENESS

“Keep by the Holy Spirit that was put on the inside of you”

Be listening to what he says.

Stay close with the relationship.

  

1. Moving forwards will take Courage

“Be strong and be with good COURAGE”

Confidence is confidant = confidence is faith.

Stepping out of your boat will take courage but everything you put your hand to will prosper.

David had courage when going to Goliath.

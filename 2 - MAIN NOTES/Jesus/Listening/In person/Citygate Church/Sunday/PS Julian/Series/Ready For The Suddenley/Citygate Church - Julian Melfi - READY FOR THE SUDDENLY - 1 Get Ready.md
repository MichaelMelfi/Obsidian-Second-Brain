Isiah 54 1-6

|1 ¶ “Sing, O barren, <br><br>You who have not borne!<br><br>Break forth into singing, and cry aloud,<br><br>You who have not labored with child!<br><br>For more are the children of the desolate<br><br>Than the children of the married woman,” says the LORD.|
|2 “Enlarge the place of your tent,<br><br>And let them stretch out the curtains of your dwellings;<br><br>Do not spare;<br><br>Lengthen your cords,<br><br>And strengthen your stakes.|
|3 For you shall expand to the right and to the left,<br><br>And your descendants will inherit the nations,<br><br>And make the desolate cities inhabited.|
|4 “Do not fear, for you will not be ashamed;<br><br>Neither be disgraced, for you will not be put to shame;<br><br>For you will forget the shame of your youth,<br><br>And will not remember the reproach of your widowhood anymore.|
|5 For your Maker is your husband,<br><br>The LORD of hosts is His name;<br><br>And your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel;<br><br>He is called the God of the whole earth.|
|6 For the LORD has called you<br><br>Like a woman forsaken and grieved in spirit,<br><br>Like a youthful wife when you were refused,”<br><br>Says your God|

  

“You shall expand to the left and the right”

  

“God shall give you double honour”

  

THIS IS OUR SEASON FOR THE SUDDENLY.

  

Don’t go to people with things you need to get from God. God is our acceptance, God is our joy, God is our strength.

  

God said let out ALL of your nets but because they only let out ONE net they almost lost all their catch as they weren’t PREPARED and didn’t do what God said so they were not ready for the amount that God was going to give them!!!

  

Just because our lives are in the hands on God doesn’t mean me shouldn’t prepare for things coming.

  

We are not expecting problems but we prepare for challenges / the storms of life.

  

God can take you out of your fail but you don’t prepare to fail.

  

Prepare to leave where you are, so when God makes you leave you are ready and PREPARED

  

If you God is going to strengthen you, be prepared to carry more weight.

  

  

  

1. NO MORE SMALL THINKING

  

  

Your faith is at the end of the process even when your at the first step.

  

Reject smallness/small thinking

  

NOT small beginning but things that will put God and you in a box that will stop you growing!

  

Think the thoughts of God and god does not think small. He wants you to expand!!

  

Build hope as God is the God of all hope.

  

If God is SMALL in your thinking, you will not turn to him when you have BIG problems

  

  

  

1. HEALTHY CONNECTIONS

  

  

Ropes on a tent come in all sorts of shapes and sizes but ropes anchor the tent or thing is it attached to. It makes us stable

  

Make sure you have the right rope (people) around you so you can be stable and have the healthy connections.

  

DO NOT ABUSE PEOPLES TRUST

If the rope (person) needs to move as it can now not take the weight of the tent (your life) then move the rope (person) into the right place and into the right foundation so it can take the weight.

  

  

  

1. DIG DEEP

  

  

Drive the tent pegs in deep into the ground and make sure they are large tent pegs so they do not come out.

  

If you want a big tree then take it out of the small pot!

  

  

  

1. STRETCH FORWARDS

  

  

If you don’t stretch you snap when pressure is on you.

Visions, people and goals stretch you.

  

  

1. GIVE IT EVERYTHING

  

  

Have a passion to grow meaning everything you out your mind to is to grow in God and relationally.

  

  

  

1. READY FOR THE SUDDENLY

  

  

You’re going to need lots of elbow room for the suddenly.

  

You will need a lot of space.

  

Do you have space for the bigger?

  

Can you fit the new in?

  

Change starts gradually.

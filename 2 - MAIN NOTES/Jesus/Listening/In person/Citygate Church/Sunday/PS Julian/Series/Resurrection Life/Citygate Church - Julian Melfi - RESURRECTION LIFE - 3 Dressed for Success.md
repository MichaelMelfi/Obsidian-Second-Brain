# Citygate Church - Julian Melfi - RESURRECTION LIFE - 3 Dressed for Success
Colossians 3 1-3

  

|   |   |
|---|---|
|1 ¶ If then you were raised with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ is, sitting at the right hand of God.|we are not ashamed to be a Christian!|
|2 Set your mind on things above, not on things on the earth.|Set your eyes on Jesus not the world|
|3 For you died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.|Through his blood|

  

|   |   |
|---|---|
|12 ¶ Therefore, as theelect of God, holy and beloved, put on tender mercies, kindness, humility, meekness, longsuffering;|I am Holy, it is not just a thing that you are. I AM HOLY, I was pulled out of death and into life and sit with God.|
|13 bearing with one another, and forgiving one another, if anyone has a complaint against another; even as Christ forgave you, so you also must do.|The opposite of complaining is forgiveness.|
|14 But above all these things put on love, which is the bond of perfection.|Just like when we were younger in age and our parents use to have to clothe us before going out and they then start to let you get dressed ourselves and you end up being able to always dress yourself before going out. When we are young in Christ, Jesus clothes us but as we grow in Christ Jesus gives us what we need and we have to clothe ourselves. E.G He has given us the garments of praise, but it is our responsibility to put it on. E.G He has given us the armour of the Lord but it is our responsibility to put it all on.|
|15 And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to which also you were called in one body; and be thankful.||
|16 Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.||
|17 And whatever you do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through Him.||

  

There’s more to life than learning keys, you might have all the keys, but they are useless on your waist if you are not able to open all the doors at the same time or actually opening a door.

  

We must be dressed/clothed with Christ.

You must put on the things that you are not good at. 

  

The reason Jesus says to put on love, its because love always wins.

The reason Jesus says to put on joy, it’s because joy always wins.

The reason Jesus says to put on forgiveness, its because love always wins.

WHAT EVER THE BIBLE TELLS YOU TO PUT ON PUT IT ON BECAUSE IT ALWAYS WINS.

  

The longer you go through life the more you only trust certain things.

You must trust in god and not just what you know and feel comfortable with as he knows the bigger picture and what is best.

  

Proverbs 3:5-6

|   |   |
|---|---|
|5 Trust in the LORD with all your heart,<br><br>And lean not on your own understanding;||
|6 In all your ways acknowledge Him,<br><br>And He shall directfn your paths.||

  

Jeremiah 17:7-8

|   |   |
|---|---|
|7 “Blessed is the man who trusts in the LORD,<br><br>And whose hope is the LORD.||
|8 For he shall be like a tree planted by the waters,||

  

Psalms 13:5-6

|   |   |
|---|---|
|5 But I have trusted in Your mercy;<br><br>My heart shall rejoice in Your salvation.||
|6 I will sing to the LORD,<br><br>Because He has dealt bountifully with me.||

  

Am I trusting God?

  

We have everything we ever need on the inside of us. Peace? We’ve got it. Joy? We’ve got it.

But sometimes you must have it on you as-well.

  

E.G when you are baptised you get baptised in the Holy Spirit and washed clean on the inside of you however you must be washed and put into water and have actual water over you.

  

TRUST IN THE BELOW

  

- HIS LOVE

When you sin you must trust in the love of God and run to him! As he LOVES ME ALWAYS.

NOTHING SHALL SEPARATE ME FROM THE LOVE.

  

- HIS PEACE

His peace calmed every storm.

Just like the story of the guys on the boat in the storm.

He spoke peace and it calmed the storm, they woke him and he calmed the storm but he said that they didn’t even need to wake him as they could have done it themselves as they had it inside them the whole time but they didn’t trust the peace to do it themselves.

But even if you mess up and don’t trust God, he’s still got you because God is always in your boat.

  

- HIS WORD

His word NEVER returns void.

What ever he says will happen.

By his stripes I was healed.

Read proverbs.

  

- HIS GRACE

Grace is an empowering thing, it is not just undeserved favour.

He will make me stand even if I am wobbling through his grace.

I win through his grace. 

When Paul had the throne in his side and was asking to take his thorn away, god said no because he had everything he had to take it out himself through Gods GRACE.

  

If Jesus isn’t the first name you speak then what are you trusting in and putting first?

  

The bible says- When we serve one another, we serve His name.

WE ARE HIS NAME SINCE BAPTISM AS WE GOT NAMED WITH A NEW NAME WHICH IS THE NAME OF JESUS.

# Citygate Church - Julian Melfi - Gods Best For My Life 1
The world is going one way, the kingdom is going another way. Forcefully advancing

  

The best is NOW so don’t waste a moment of what God is doing.

  

Make sure you are in a place where 

  

Happ is an experience

  

If something HAPPens that’s good then you are HAPPy

  

If something HAPPens that’s bad then you are unHAPPy

  

But JOY is a constant thing that defeated all enemies.

  

John 2:1-11

Water into wine

|   |   |
|---|---|
|1 ¶ On the third day there was a wedding in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there.||
|2 Now both Jesus and His disciples were invited to the wedding.||
|3 And when they ran out of wine, the mother of Jesus said to Him, “They have no wine.”||
|4 ¶ Jesus said to her, “Woman, what does your concern have to do with Me? My hour has not yet come.”||
|5 ¶ His mother said to the servants, “Whatever He says to you, do it.”|Sometimes we have to stop thinking and wanting details and just do what ever God tells you too without question.|
|6 ¶ Now there were set there six waterpots of stone, according to the manner of purification of the Jews, containing twenty or thirty gallons apiece.||
|7 Jesus said to them, “Fill the waterpots with water.” And they filled them up to the brim.||
|8 And He said to them, “Draw some out now, and take it to the master of the feast.” And they took it.|He doesn’t tell them anything else to do except take it to the master. Sometimes you just have to do what he tells you without knowing the detail.|
|9 When the master of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and did not know where it came from (but the servants who had drawn the water knew), the master of the feast called the bridegroom.||
|10 And he said to him, “Every man at the beginning sets out the good wine, and when the guests have well drunk, then the inferior. You have kept the good wine until now!”|God is the God of BEST, he doesn’t do mediocre. He is the BEST in everything. Nothing else comes close.                        The world thinks it’s best to bring the good wine out first and the worse win last but GOD bring out the best last.|
|11 ¶ This beginning of signs Jesus did in Cana of Galilee, and manifested His glory; and His disciples believed in Him.||

  

When something bad happens like a tsunami everyone blames God but when something good happens they say there is no God and it’s just a coincidence.

  

God is the best,

God has the best,

God gives the best

  

God is all good,

There is light in him there is no darkness.

There is life in him there is no death.

There is joy in him there is no unhappiness 

There is love in him there is no hate

  

Stop looking through a rear view mirror!

The best is now.

GODS BEST IS NOT BEHIND ME it is NOW.

  

- GODS BEST IS NOT JUST FOR OTHER PEOPLE

He doesn’t just heal their body, healing is for me!

  

Gods best is for me!

  

Don’t settle for second best, Gods best is for ME and it’s NOW!

If something is not the best then it didn’t come from God because God only gives the best so you cannot settle for second best as it’s not what God wants for your life.

  

Sometimes the best is that you are still standing after the storm or that the fire didn’t burn you.

Because sometimes the storm or fire is what breaks your chains and heals you!!!

Shadrack Meshak and Abednimo in the fire.

Lazarus when he died and got risen from the dead.

  

Thank God for things he has saved you from that you don’t know happened.

  

- GODS BEST GETS BETTER WITH TIME

  

God does things the opposite way from the world.

  

The world thinks it’s best to bring the good wine out first and the worse win last but GOD bring out the best last.

  

Stick with it, don’t give up or leave the cinema before God has done the after clip!!!

  

- GOD WILL DO WHAT HE SAID HE WILL DO.

  

I will not accept anything else other than GODS BEST for my life

  

Habakkuk 2:2-4

|2 ¶ Then the LORD answered me and said:<br><br>  <br><br>“Write the vision<br><br>And make it plain on tablets,<br><br>That he may run who reads it.||
|3 For the vision is yet for an appointed time;<br><br>But at the end it will speak, and it will not lie.<br><br>Though it tarries, wait for it;<br><br>Because it will surely come,<br><br>It will not tarry.||
|4 “Behold the proud,<br><br>His soul is not upright in him;<br><br>But the just shall live by his faith.||

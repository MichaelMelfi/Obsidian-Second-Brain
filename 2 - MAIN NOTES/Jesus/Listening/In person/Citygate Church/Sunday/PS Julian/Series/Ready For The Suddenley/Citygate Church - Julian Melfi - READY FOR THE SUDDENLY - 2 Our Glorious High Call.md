# Citygate Church - Julian Melfi - READY FOR THE SUDDENLY - 2 Our Glorious High Call
Isaiah 53:1

|   |
|---|
|1 ¶ “Sing, O barren, <br><br>You who have not borne!<br><br>Break forth into singing, and cry aloud,<br><br>You who have not labored with child!<br><br>For more are the children of the desolate<br><br>Than the children of the married woman,” says the LORD.|
|2 “Enlarge the place of your tent,<br><br>And let them stretch out the curtains of your dwellings;<br><br>Do not spare;<br><br>Lengthen your cords,<br><br>And strengthen your stakes.|
|3 For you shall expand to the right and to the left,<br><br>And your descendants will inherit the nations,<br><br>And make the desolate cities inhabited.|
|4 “Do not fear, for you will not be ashamed;<br><br>Neither be disgraced, for you will not be put to shame;<br><br>For you will forget the shame of your youth,<br><br>And will not remember the reproach of your widowhood anymore.|
|5 For your Maker is your husband,<br><br>The LORD of hosts is His name;<br><br>And your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel;<br><br>He is called the God of the whole earth.|
|6 For the LORD has called you<br><br>Like a woman forsaken and grieved in spirit,<br><br>Like a youthful wife when you were refused,”<br><br>Says your God|

  

  

Remember the things God tells you to remember.

Not the event but the truth of what it represents.

EG not that Jesus was raised from the dead but that we have resurrection power in us.

  

Anyone outside of the body of Christ has no significance. As you can only get significants and a calling from God.

  

He is the God of the whole earth. But he is also my God.

As he is the God of the whole earth he can move heaven and earth for you to fulfill your calling.

  

He is God the redeemer.

  

He is the Lord of hosts the captain of the army.

Because is the captain of the army, he can fight off any enemy that comes against you.

  

If you are called by God to do something you CANNOT fail no matter what it is.

  

  

- WHAT IS A CALLING?

  

We are called to the Lord of Jesus Christ.

 Mark 3:13

  

13 ¶ And He went up on the mountain and called to Him those He Himself wanted. And they came to Him.

  

Is time just through a song or is tune with him actually with him, calling to him.

  

  

  

  

  

PART 2

  

Mark 3:13

13 ¶ And He went up on the mountain and called to Him those He Himself wanted. And they came to Him.

  

  

We are called for 

GLORY - FREEDOM - PURPOSE

  

2 Peter 1:3

3 as His divine power has given to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of Him who called us by glory and virtue,

  

  

Mark 3:13-15

|   |
|---|
|13 ¶ And He went up on the mountain and called to Him those He Himself wanted. And they came to Him.|
|14 Then He appointed twelve,fn that they might be with Him and that He might send them out to preach,|
|15 and to have power to heal sicknesses andfn to cast out demons|

  

Romans 11:29

  

29 For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable [for He does not withdraw what He has given, nor does He change His mind about those to whom He gives His grace or to whom He sends His call]

  

2 Timothy 1:8-9

|   |
|---|
|8 ¶ Therefore do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me His prisoner, but share with me in the sufferings for the gospel according to the power of God,|
|9 who has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to His own purpose and grace which was given to us in Christ Jesus before time began|

  

  

I BELONG TO GOD, HE BOUGHT ME WITH HIS BLOOD. 

Just like buying something from a shop and leaving with the item it is now yours.

God paid with his blood and took me out of the shop (sin) and put me in his house (at the right hand of God)

# Citygate Church - Julian Melfi - GIANT KILLERS - 2 The Making Of a Giant Killer
Giant killers are made not born

What made Daniel a giant killer?

  

The prodicle son

If you’re not made then what you get given can kill you.

The prodicle son was given everything before he was MADE, that’s why he went down the bad path.

He goes to his father and says GIVE ME your inheritance but then when he returned back after all the mess he goes to his father and says MAKE ME like one of your servants.

The anointing doesn’t make you a great man it just empowers whatever you already are, if you are greedy then you will be more greedy.

  

1 Samual 16:11-21

David anointed King

  

|   |   |
|---|---|
|11 And Samuel said to Jesse, “Are all the young men here?” Then he said, “There remains yet the youngest, and there he is, keeping the sheep.” And Samuel said to Jesse, “Send and bring him. For we will not sit downfntill he comes here.”||
|12 So he sent and brought him in. Now he wasruddy, with bright eyes, and good-looking. And the LORD said, “Arise, anoint him; for this is the one!”|This was at 15 years old.|
|13 Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brothers; and the Spirit of the LORD came upon David from that day forward. So Samuel arose and went to Ramah.||
|A Distressing Spirit Troubles Saul<br><br>14 ¶ But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and a distressing spirit from the LORDtroubled him.||
|15 And Saul’s servants said to him, “Surely, a distressing spirit from God is troubling you.||
|16 “Let our master now command your servants, who are before you, to seek out a man who is a skillful player on the harp. And it shall be that he will play it with his hand when the distressing spirit from God is upon you, and you shall be well.”||
|17 ¶ So Saul said to his servants, “Provide me now a man who can play well, and bring himto me.”||
|18 ¶ Then one of the servants answered and said, “Look, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, who is skillful in playing, a mighty man of valor, a man of war, prudent in speech, and a handsome person; and the LORD is with him.”||
|19 ¶ Therefore Saul sent messengers to Jesse, and said, “Send me your son David, who iswith the sheep.”||
|20 And Jesse took a donkey loaded with bread, a skin of wine, and a young goat, and sent them by his son David to Saul.||
|21 So David came to Saul and stood before him. And he loved him greatly, and he became his armorbearer.||

  

What made David a giant killer?

  

1. He was a guy after Gods own heart

  

He was hungry and passionate for God who did all his will

  

The anointing doesn’t make you a great man it just empowers whatever you already are, if you are greedy then you will be more greedy.

If you are after gods heart before the anointing then you will be more after Gods own heart after the anointing.

  

  

1. He could affect and change the atmosphere 

  

Be someone that you walk into a room and the room changes.

When you walk in the room, demons leave.

Where ever you go you bring in the presence and glory of God.

  

  

1. Skilful

  

Understand excellence and be it.

When you have a gift you didn’t have to work for it so you don’t make it better.

To Be skilful you have to work at what you have no matter if it’s a gift or not.

If David did not kill the bear and lion he wouldn’t have been able to kill Goliath.

  

  

1. Courageous - firmness of mind mental or moral strength.

  

Being able to stand up instead of fall over or when you fall over you stand back up no matter how bad the fall was.

  

  

1. A fighter

  

David was called a man or war however he had not been in any battles!!

He was a war on the inside and had the fight in him before he was ever in any battles.

To be an advancer and a fighter and not give up or quite easy.

  

  

1. Prudent in speech / wise

  

He was wise beyond his years.

Speaking words that people want to hear and can draw from.

There is nothing more important than the words you speak.

Your words save you to Christ, your words pray prayers, your words give you healing, your words cast out demons, the your words and life and death.

  

  

1. Good looking

  

The world is more interested fake eyelashes, BBLs, selfies, how we look.

We are now way more fixated on the outside than our inside.

If we spent the same amount of time getting ready to meet with God than we do getting ready to meet people. The world would be a different place.

  

The attractiveness is in the heart not the outside.

  

  

1. Amour bearer

  

Even though David was king he knew he needed to be another kings armour bearer. He needed to serve someone else.

  

Gods armour bearer book.

  

What you do for others, god will get others to do for you.

  

Do not do things to get someone to do it for you. You serve others just because that’s what Christians do.

  

Jesus washed someone’s feet not to get His own feet washed but they did end up washing His feet.

  

How can we help others dreams come to pass

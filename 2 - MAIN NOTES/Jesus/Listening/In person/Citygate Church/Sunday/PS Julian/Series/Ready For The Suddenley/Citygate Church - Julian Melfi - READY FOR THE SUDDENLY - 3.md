|9 “For this is like the waters of Noah to Me;<br><br>For as I have sworn<br><br>That the waters of Noah would no longer cover the earth,<br><br>SO I HAVE SWORN<br><br>That I would not be angry with you, nor rebuke you.|
|10 For the mountains shall depart<br><br>And the hills be removed,<br><br>But My kindness shall not depart from you,<br><br>Nor shall My covenant of peace be removed,”<br><br>Says the LORD, who has mercy on you|

  

Everything in the Bible is truth and 100% correct and Gods never lies or faults his word, so when God says ‘I have sworn’ it is like a double whammy, as everything he says he already swears by but he is making sure we know he is swearing on whatever he is talking about.

  

Our calling is to be Jesus to this generation.

  

Just like how God promised that he wouldn’t flood the world again he has sworn all the above and below.

|11 “O you afflicted one,<br><br>Tossed with tempest, and not comforted,<br><br>Behold, I will lay your stones with colorful gems,<br><br>And lay your foundations with sapphires.|
|12 I will make your pinnacles of rubies,<br><br>Your gates of crystal,<br><br>And all your walls of precious stones.|
|13 All your children shall be taught by the LORD,<br><br>And great shall be the peace of your children.|
|14 In righteousness you shall be established;<br><br>You shall be far from oppression, for you shall not fear;<br><br>And from terror, for it shall not come near you.|

You will not look like what you went through.

You will be covered in precious metals and crystals.

  

It is impossible for God to lie.

  

There will be troubles in this world but we are in the world and not of the world.

Just like the tempest had to get through the storm.

  

To get through the storm we must:

  

1. Prioritise partnership

You must do everything together

Corporate worship and prayer.

  

I am more Christian than I am White.

I am more Christian than I am a man.

My identity is Son Of God.

  

What would have happened if Peter was to walk on the water with Jesus with a couple or other people.

They would have kept his eyes fixed on the lord and lifted him up so he wouldn’t have sunk.

  

  

1. Remember the covenant of peace

  

  

  

1. Receive by faith Gods provision of abundant life

Your scars are testimonies of when you fought the devil and won.

Your scars are now covered in precious metals and crystals.

  

  

Psalm 105:37

  

Haggai 2:6-9

##### What Did I Learn From This Teaching?:

DO NOT BACK DOWN
Stand until you have nothing left.
You greatest battles come before your greatest victory and breakthrough.
# Citygate Church - Julian Melfi - Pursue, Overtake, Recover all





## Offering

“Trust in the Lord with all your heart, And lean not on your own understanding; In all your ways acknowledge Him, And He shall direct your paths. Do not be wise in your own eyes; Fear the Lord and depart from evil.”
‭‭Proverbs‬ ‭3‬:‭5‬-‭7‬ ‭NKJV‬‬
https://bible.com/bible/114/pro.3.5-7.NKJV

“Honor the Lord with your possessions, And with the firstfruits of all your increase; So your barns will be filled with plenty, And your vats will overflow with new wine.”
‭‭Proverbs‬ ‭3‬:‭9‬-‭10‬ ‭NKJV‬‬
https://bible.com/bible/114/pro.3.9-10.NKJV

Sometimes it’s hard to trust god with ALL your heart.
This doesn’t mean trust in God 70% and 30% in your job.
It means 100%! He is the only constant and only thing that is secure.

Money isn’t just for you. But you need more money to bless others and push the kingdom forward!

## Preach

Put your faith into the wonder of God.
He is wonderful.
He does signs and WONDERS. He wants to show you more wonderful things of who He is and what he can do.

The more you say use God describing things as every day things then it diminishes God in your eyes.
If a coffee is awesome and God is awesome then God is as good as a cup of coffee.

There is a river of praise and you’ve got to be jumping in the river and giving praise!

> “Now it happened, when David and his men came to Ziklag, on the third day, that the Amalekites had invaded the South and Ziklag, attacked Ziklag and burned it with fire, and had taken captive the women and those who were there, from small to great; they did not kill anyone, but carried them away and went their way. So David and his men came to the city, and there it was, burned with fire; and their wives, their sons, and their daughters had been taken captive. Then David and the people who were with him lifted up their voices and wept, until they had no more power to weep. And David’s two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the widow of Nabal the Carmelite, had been taken captive. Now David was greatly distressed, for the people spoke of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons and his daughters. But David strengthened himself in the Lord his God. Then David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech’s son, “Please bring the ephod here to me.” And Abiathar brought the ephod to David. So David inquired of the Lord, saying, “Shall I pursue this troop? Shall I overtake them?” And He answered him, “Pursue, for you shall surely overtake them and without fail recover all.””
==‭‭I Samuel‬ ‭30‬:‭1‬-‭8‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/1sa.30.1-8.NKJV

Keep hold of what God has put in your responsibility.
Fight for what God has given to you and do not back down.

David refused to back down and run away
He was a MAN after Gods own heart.
He stood in faith and by faith we stand!

In this passage he is defeating the philastines.
He was expecting to come back to his wife and kids to come and greet them and celebrate with them.

But they actually came back to the whole city of fire and didn’t know if the kids and wife’s were alive.

### Do not half ass Gods instruction!
> “Now it happened, when David and his men came to Ziklag, on the third day, that the Amalekites had invaded the South and Ziklag, attacked Ziklag and burned it with fire, and had taken captive the women and those who were there, from small to great; they did not kill anyone, but carried them away and went their way.”
==‭‭I Samuel‬ ‭30‬:‭1‬-‭2‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/1sa.30.1-2.NKJV

In Deuteronomy God told the Israelites to kill all the Amalekites but because they didn’t they only did half a job.
The Amalekites came back and destroyed the city in the future!
Make sure you carry out every thing God tells you to the fullest otherwise it will come back to get you.
They were Israel’s thorn in the flesh.

You can be in the will of God and things can happen.
David was in the will of God and doing what God said but things happened.

### Weeping
> “So David and his men came to the city, and there it was, burned with fire; and their wives, their sons, and their daughters had been taken captive. Then David and the people who were with him lifted up their voices and wept, until they had no more power to weep.”
==‭‭I Samuel‬ ‭30‬:‭3‬-‭4‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/1sa.30.3-4.NKJV

It is not wrong to weep at what you’re going through.
David’s men were tough but still wept.
But what is wrong is that you stay there. You cannot stay there. You cannot stay is a weeping state you must press forward.

### Stand!
> “And David’s two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the widow of Nabal the Carmelite, had been taken captive. Now David was greatly distressed, for the people spoke of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons and his daughters. But David strengthened himself in the Lord his God.”
==‭‭I Samuel‬ ‭30‬:‭5‬-‭6‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/1sa.30.5-6.NKJV

Everything was going wrong but he stop strong!
It doesn’t matter what is going on around you. You must stand!
You cannot make life changing decisions when you are in turmoil. You stand until it clears!
We are not of those of quit, WE STAND.

If you quit. You have already sealed the outcome on the situation.

People now want to stone David!
It’s all gone wrong so let’s kill the leader. Gods chosen man, the man after Gods own heart. Idiots

Now David strengthened himself in the Lord.

### Pursure, overtake and recover all!
> “Then David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech’s son, “Please bring the ephod here to me.” And Abiathar brought the ephod to David. So David inquired of the Lord, saying, “Shall I pursue this troop? Shall I overtake them?” And He answered him, “Pursue, for you shall surely overtake them and without fail recover all.””
==‭‭I Samuel‬ ‭30‬:‭7‬-‭8‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/1sa.30.7-8.NKJV

David does not ask WHY.
He asks WHAT can I do so he can stand with faith.

He doesn’t ask from his feelings, he asks from his faith.

You SHALL SURLY overtake.
God did not have to back up His word with a surly he could have just said you will overtake them. But he wanted David to know that without any doubt he will be able to overtake it all!

There are surly all over your life!
You will surly have your healing
You will surly have your mountain moved.
Surly goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life

David was days away from stepping into his greatest day. Becoming the king of Israel.
It is no coincidence that his greatest battle was when he was about to have his greatest victory and breakthrough.

Do not be surprised when the enemy comes in like a flood. Because it is when you are about to BREAKTHROUGH!

When everything is going wrong it is time to double down!

### Do we go forwards or backwards

ARISE AND BUILD 1

  

Nehemiah 2:18-20

|   |
|---|
|18 And I told them of the hand of my God which had been good upon me, and also of the king’s words that he had spoken to me. So they said, “Let us rise up and build.” Then they set their hands to thisgood work.|
|19 ¶ But when Sanballat the Horonite, Tobiah the Ammonite official, and Geshem the Arab heard of it,they laughed at us and despised us, and said, “What is this thing that you are doing? Will you rebel against the king?”|
|20 ¶ So I answered them, and said to them, “The God of heaven Himself will prosper us; therefore we His servants will arise and build, but you have no heritage or right or memorial in Jerusalem.|

  

‭

You must fan yourself into flame

  

People remember the fall but did you see how I got back up again!!

  

If the world is going one way go the opposite direction. Don’t listen to the WORLD, listen to the WORD

  

They will know that you are Christian by how you love people.

  

You have to maintain things like your walk with God however do not just maintain and stay where you are. We are builders that should keep moving forward by being on fire with God to see our world come to Christ.

  

Your mind is the deciding factor or where you life will end up. You have the mind of Christ and the helmet of salvation.

  

Everything and everyone is competing for your thoughts but keep your thoughts on things above and not of things below.

  

The mind of Christ is what God breaths in my heart.

  

When Moses parted the Red Sea the community were in the desert for 40 years because of their thoughts. They could not enter the promise land until they thought like God.

Pull up your tent pegs and move forward E.G. take out your bad thoughts and the things holding you down and move forward and put your hands to work.

  

- BUILDERS MOVE UPWARDS

  

Haggai‬ ‭1‬:‭7‬ ‭- 8

“Thus says the Lord of hosts: “Consider your ways!“

”Go up to the mountains and bring wood and build the temple, that I may take pleasure in it and be glorified,” says the Lord.“

  

- ‭how to get ahold of the word

1. Read the word / Bible
2. Hear the word of God / listen to people preach
3. Study the word of God /  Study the bible
4. Meditate on the word of God / speak the word of God to yourself

By speaking it to yourself you cannot think of bad things and nothing can compete with your thoughts.

  

If we want to go up with God we have to go down with our humility.

  

To be able to move up, you have to raise your thoughts to Gods thoughts

  

Mount up with wings like an eagle. EG see everything from the eyes of God as if you are an eagle flying that can see everything and focus on one specific thing.

  

- You must start at the mountain top and everything happens when you are in the highest place.

  

1. God gave the commandments on the mountain 

  

1. Baal was defeated on the mountain top

  

1. The ark rested on the mountain top

  

1. Jesus ascended into heaven from a mountain top

  

1. When Jesus transfigured himself it happened on a mountain top

# Citygate Church - Julian Melfi - Revealed - 2 Walking In Truth
John 17

Offering:

  

2 Corinthians

  

“But this I say: He who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and he who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully. So let each one give as he purposes in his heart, not grudgingly or of necessity; for God loves a cheerful giver. And God is able to make all grace abound toward you, that you, always having all sufficiency in all things, may have an abundance for every good work. As it is written: “He has dispersed abroad, He has given to the poor; His righteousness endures forever.””

‭‭II Corinthians‬ ‭9‬:‭6‬-‭9‬ ‭NKJV‬‬

  

God doesn’t care about the amount, but the heart and the motive of why you have given.

  

He who doesn’t give to God is actually robbing God.

  

  

  

Preach:

  

  

John 17

  

This is the LAST few hours before the capturing of Jesus.

|14 “I have given them Your word; and the world has hated them because they are not of the world, just as I am not of the world.|
|15 “I do not pray that You should take them out of the world, but that You should keep them from the evil one.|
|16 “They are not of the world, just as I am not of the world.|
|17 “Sanctify them by Your truth. Your word is truth.|
|18 “As You sent Me into the world, I also have sent them into the world.|
|19 “And for their sakes I sanctify (being set apart or make righteous) Myself, that they also may be sanctified by the truth.|

  

  

  

14 “I have given them Your word; and the world has hated them because they are not of the world, just as I am not of the world.”

‭‭John‬ ‭17‬:‭14‬ ‭NKJV‬‬

  

They didn’t even have a book yet, they didn’t have the bible yet. They only had the word of God which was now inside them. 

With His word, people were healed (the word is exactly the same as our Bible, and the Bible is exactly the same as Gods word!) 

1 John and Genesis. His WORD created things.

  

He gave them the WORD and they were hated. We will be HATED by the world, not loved. So many people think if you are Christian you will be loved but the Bible says the opposite it true!!

If the world is not hating you then you are not of Jesus, but of the WORLD

So many people chase the world then follow God after but you must follow God FIRST and THEN glory and riches will follow you!

  

If you are a friend of the world then you are an enemy to God.

  

3 John 2-4

  

The Bible is the word and the word is truth so you can change the word truth for ‘word’ or ‘bible’

|2 ¶ Beloved, I pray that you may prosper in all things and be in health, just as your soul prospers.|
|3 For I rejoiced greatly when brethren came and testified of the truth that is in you, just as you walk in the truth.|
|4 I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.|

  

  

As we walk in the TRUTH it WILL bring wholeness and freedom in every area of my life

  

  

How do we receive Gods knowledge

  

1. Revelation from Divine Intervention 

  

God just does something suddenly, you might be in worship or in a conversation and something suddenly hits you.

  

  

1. Revelation from Meditation of Gods word

  

Speak to yourself!

  

This does NOT mean empty your mind as the enemy then has a place to fill.

This on things that are PURE, LOVELY, PEACELOVING

  

When you pray, SAY

Luke 11:2

There is nowhere in scripture where there is a thought prayer.

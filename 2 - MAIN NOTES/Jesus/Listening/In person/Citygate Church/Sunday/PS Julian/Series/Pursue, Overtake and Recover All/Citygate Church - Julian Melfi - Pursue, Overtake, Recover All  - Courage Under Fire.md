# Citygate Church - Julian Melfi - Pursue, Overtake, Recover All 2

### Strengthen yourself
> “David was now in great danger because all his men were very bitter about losing their sons and daughters, and they began to talk of stoning him. But David found strength in the Lord his God.”
‭‭==1 Samuel‬ ‭30‬:‭6‬ ‭NLT‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/116/1sa.30.6.NLT

The enemy always brings division.
If there is a division thing happening it is always a work from Satan.

BUT DAVID STRENGTHEND HIMSELF IN GOD
This was personal.
People can pray with you and help you but they cannot do your Forgivness for you, turn around for you.
You must do everything together as we are the body of Christ.

But other things you must make the decision yourself when everyone is against you.

“Then he said to Abiathar the priest, “Bring me the ephod!” So Abiathar brought it.”
‭‭1 Samuel‬ ‭30‬:‭7‬ ‭NLT‬‬
https://bible.com/bible/116/1sa.30.7.NLT

This is David saying I need to speak to God as this is how they spoke to God.

> “And David inquired of the Lord, “Shall I pursue after this band? Shall I overtake them?” He answered him, “Pursue, for you shall surely overtake and shall surely rescue.””
==‭‭1 Samuel‬ ‭30‬:‭8‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/1sa.30.8.ESV

You shall SURLEY Overtake them and WITHOUT FAIL recover all.

### What is courage?
- That which enables a person to face hardship, danger or pain with a firmness of mind
- The ability to do something that frightens you

David all through his life went against what made him afraid and encouraged himself.
You do not need courage unless there is fear there.

The Christian life is about what we do when things are not in line.
When we don't have enough but still give to others
When we are not happy but still jump for joy.

If you believe the lies of the enemy you will be paralysed in life and not be able to move forward.

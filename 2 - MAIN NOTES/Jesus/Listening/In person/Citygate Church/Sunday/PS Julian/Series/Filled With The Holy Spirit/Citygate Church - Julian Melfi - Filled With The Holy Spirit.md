##### What Did I Learn From This Teaching?:

## Citygate Church - Julian Melfi -  Filled With The Holy Spirit

> “for at one time you were darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Walk as children of light (for the fruit of light is found in all that is good and right and true), and try to discern what is pleasing to the Lord. Take no part in the unfruitful works of darkness, but instead expose them. For it is shameful even to speak of the things that they do in secret. But when anything is exposed by the light, it becomes visible, for anything that becomes visible is light. Therefore it says, “Awake, O sleeper, and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you.” Look carefully then how you walk, not as unwise but as wise, making the best use of the time, because the days are evil. Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is. And do not get drunk with wine, for that is debauchery, but be filled with the Spirit, addressing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody to the Lord with your heart, giving thanks always and for everything to God the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,”
‭‭==Ephesians‬ ‭5‬:‭8‬-‭20‬ ‭ESV‬‬==

For you were once darkness.
It doesn’t say you were in darkness but it says you
WERE DARKNESS
You are not in the light you 
ARE NOW LIGHT
If you have lost love then you have lost sight of what you were redeemed from in God.
God loves you unconditionally.
You do not need something artificial 

If water stays int he bottle it might look good and taste nice but it can’t do anything in the bottle.
You worship and praise cannot do anything if it stays in your heart.
You are not called to be a resevier but you are called to be a flood river

It says give thanks always for everything
You give that’s to God in every situation. You don’t thank you for sickness etc but you thank God while you are sick saying thank you thank I’m coming out the other side.

> “Nevertheless, I tell you the truth: it is to your advantage that I go away, for if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you. But if I go, I will send him to you. And when he comes, he will convict the world concerning sin and righteousness and judgment: concerning sin, because they do not believe in me; concerning righteousness, because I go to the Father, and you will see me no longer; concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world is judged. “I still have many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now. When the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all the truth, for he will not speak on his own authority, but whatever he hears he will speak, and he will declare to you the things that are to come.”
‭‭==John‬ ‭16‬:‭7‬-‭13‬ ‭ESV‬‬==

> ““Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever believes in me will also do the works that I do; and greater works than these will he do, because I am going to the Father. Whatever you ask in my name, this I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If you ask me anything in my name, I will do it. “If you love me, you will keep my commandments. And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Helper, to be with you forever, even the Spirit of true, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees him nor knows him. You know him, for he dwells with you and will be in you.”
‭‭==John‬ ‭14‬:‭12‬-‭17‬ ‭ESV‬‬==

A lot of people believe in God but don’t believe God
Even the devil believes in God.

Romans chapter 8 full chapter
A lot of people would say all the quotes from Romans 8 EG 
- there is no condemnation
- All things work together for good
The actual reason for the chapter is about the Holy Spirit.
It is the only chapter in the whole Bible that repeats a word more than 3-4 times and it repeats it 22 time!
The word is ‘THE SPIRIT’
All the things in the chapter are as a result of the Spirit!

God does not fill you up when you as because you have lost of him
It is a constant flood.
It is a constant over flowing.
The flood of water never stops.
You can’t have less of Him.

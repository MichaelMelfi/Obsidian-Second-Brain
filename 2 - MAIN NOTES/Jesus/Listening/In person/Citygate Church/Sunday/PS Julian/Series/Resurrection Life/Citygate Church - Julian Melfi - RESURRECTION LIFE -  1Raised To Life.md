Raised to life

  

Colossians 3 1-17

  

|   |

|Not Carnality but Christ<br><br>1 ¶ If then you were raised with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ is, sitting at the right hand of God.|
|2 Set your mind on things above, not on things on the earth.|
|3 For you died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.|
|4 When Christ who is our life appears, then you also will appear with Him in glory.|
|5 ¶ Therefore put to death your members which are on the earth: fornication, uncleanness, passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry.|
|6 Because of these things the wrath of God is coming upon the sons of disobedience,|
|7 in which you yourselves once walked when you lived in them.|
|8 ¶ But now you yourselves are to put off all these: anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy language out of your mouth.|
|9 Do not lie to one another, since you have put off the old man with his deeds,|
|10 and have put on the new man who is renewed in knowledge according to the image of Him who created him,|
|11 where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcised nor uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave nor free, but Christ is all and in all.|
|Character of the New Man<br><br>12 ¶ Therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, put on tender mercies, kindness, humility, meekness, longsuffering;|
|13 bearing with one another, and forgiving one another, if anyone has a complaint against another; even as Christ forgave you, so you also must do.|
|14 But above all these things put on love, which is the bond of perfection.|
|15 And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to which also you were called in one body; and be thankful.|
|16 Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.|
|17 And whatever you do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through Him|

When you bring God into your life you are completely different from everyone else around you.

  

God is Supreme

  

Jesus is not just a better option, He is supreme.

  

1. THE VIRGIN BIRTH is central to Christian faith.

If he was not born by a virgin that means he would have been born into sin as it would have been a normal worldly earth. And if he is born into sin then He himself would need a saviour so that means He could not be God if that is true.

  

1. The Cross of Jesus Christ

  

1. The resurrection of Jesus Christ

  

  

  

1. We are a new creation because of the resurrection.
2. We died with Christ when he died on the cross.
3. We are raised with Christ.

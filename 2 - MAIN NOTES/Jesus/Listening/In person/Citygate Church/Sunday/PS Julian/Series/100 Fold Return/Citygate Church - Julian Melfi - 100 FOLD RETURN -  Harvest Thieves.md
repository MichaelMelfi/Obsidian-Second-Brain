Read the red and pray for power

This means read the words Jesus said and pray that everything that is said in it will come to pass in my life.

  

  

This parable is actually about hearing

  

What is your response/what do you do when you have heard something or got a revelation.

  

Mark 4:3-9

|   |   |
|---|---|
|3 ¶ Hearken; Behold, there went out a sower to sow:|Listen and hear!|
|4 And it came to pass, as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up.||
|5 And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth:||
|6 But when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.||
|7 And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.||
|8 And other fell on good ground, and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased; and brought forth, some thirty, and some sixty, and some an hundred.||
|9 ¶ And he said unto them, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.||

There are 6 seeds in Life

  

Word of God

  

Faith 

  

Finances

  

Jesus

We are the harvest

  

We are the seed

The world is the harvest

  

Kingdom

  

  

Satan doesn’t care if you are 

rich or poor.

Sick or well

  

However, if you are not a Christian Satan would rather you were rich.

Because if you are not a Christian and rich it amplifies your sins

  

  

  

satan steals

(Don’t be a pathway)

15

15 And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; but when they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts.

  

What we do with the seed that is sowed into our lives depends if Satan will be able to take it.

  

  

  

satan attacks

(Don’t be stony Ground)

16-17

16 And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground; who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with gladness;

17 And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time: afterward, when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word's sake, immediately they are offended.

  

  

Satan doesn’t give you sickness for the purpose to make you sick

  

satan gives you sickness to steal your revelation of ‘by His stripes I was healed’

satan gives you poverty to steal your revelation of ‘My barns are filled with and cats over flowing’

  

  

  

satan distracts

(Don’t be sown among thorns)

18-19

18 And these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear the word,

19 And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful.

  

He makes you worry so you don’t fight back.

OFFERING

Luke 21:1-4

|   |
|---|
|1 ¶ And He looked up and saw the rich putting their gifts into the treasury,|
|2 and He saw also a certain poor widow putting in two mites.|
|3 So He said, “Truly I say to you that this poor widow has put in more than all;|
|4 “for all these out of their abundance have put in offerings for God,fn but she out of her poverty put in all the livelihood that she had.”|

  

Mark 12:41-44

|   |
|---|
|41 ¶ Now Jesus sat opposite the treasury and saw how the people put money into the treasury. And many who were rich put in much.|
|42 Then one poor widow came and threw in two mites,fn which make a quadrans.|
|43 So He called His disciples to Himself and said to them, “Assuredly, I say to you that this poor widow has put in more than all those who have given to the treasury;|
|44 “for they all put in out of their abundance, but she out of her poverty put in all that she had, her whole livelihood.”|

  

It’s not about the amount, it’s about the posture and the attitude of how you give.

  

She refused to give God what is worth nothing.

  

  

PREACH

  

You can’t handle everything right now. You need to mature.

God said he cannot tell us everything because we can’t handle it.

Everything is in the Devine timing of God.

  

It’s harder work in harvest time.

That’s why you need everyone to jump in a help.

Some people just sow sow sow and never reap the harvest because they don’t get taught and don’t know how to.

  

We must be doers not just hearers of the word.

John 2:9-11

|   |   |
|---|---|
|9 When the master of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and did not know where it came from (but the servants who had drawn the water knew), the master of the feast called the bridegroom.||
|10 And he said to him, “Every man at the beginning sets out the good wine, and when the guestshave well drunk, then the inferior. You have kept the good/best wine until now!”||
|11 ¶ This beginning of signs Jesus did in Cana of Galilee, and manifested His glory; and His disciples believed in Him.||

Gods best gets better with time

  

Habakkuk 2:2-4

|   |   |
|---|---|
|The Just Live by Faith<br><br>2 ¶ Then the LORD answered me and said:<br><br>  <br><br>“Write the vision<br><br>And make it plain on tablets,<br><br>That he may run who reads it.|When you have a vision your life is faster.|
|3 For the vision isyet for an appointed time;<br><br>But at the end it will speak, and it will not lie.<br><br>Though it tarries, wait for it;<br><br>Because it will surely come,<br><br>It will not tarry(wait)|It is for an appointed time! Only God knows the time. Just like waiting at a bus stop you know it is coming but you don’t know the exact time. you must be there and early to get on the bus. If you are late or miss the bus you will miss where you want to get to or where it’s taking you. Just like God, you will be waiting for God but if you miss your opportunity you won’t be able to go with Him and what he has planned for you.|
|4 “Behold the proud,<br><br>His soul is not upright in him;<br><br>But the just shall live by his faith.||

  

Why Does God Wait?

  

Noone wants to wait and no one chooses to wait.

  

God does not wait for everything. This is only talking about the things that we cannot handle now.

E.G healing is always now because we were healed, you don’t have to wait for it.

Freedom/salvation is now you don’t have to wait.

  

Sometimes we want NOW what we cannot handle yet and God is waiting to give it to you because if he gives it to you now you will not be able to handle it.

  

If you don’t value the waiting then you won’t value the thing that God is giving to you because you didn’t have to sacrifice or earn it to get the thing.

  

Hebrews 6:11-12

|   |   |
|---|---|
|11 And we desire that each one of you show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope until the end,||
|12 that you do not become sluggish, but imitate those who through faith and patience inherit the promises.|Faith AND patience. You must have both together not just faith or just patience but it’s the faith then the waiting for the thing.|

  

James 1:4-6

|   |
|---|
|4 But let patience have its perfect work, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking nothing.|
|5 If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all liberally and without reproach, and it will be given to him.|
|6 But let him ask in faith, with no doubting, for he who doubts is like a wave of the sea driven and tossed by the wind.|

What does time do? And why is it important.

  

  

1. Time will educate us.

  

We think we know about it all but we don’t.

Time reforms your values

It sharpens our discernments 

  

  

1. Time will expose/reveal things you currently can’t see.

  

Sometimes you think you see it clearly, only to see it differently over time.

You don’t know a tree by its seed but you know a tree by the fruit it produces!!!!

Time will reveal deception that we didn’t know at the time. As all bad things come to light through time.

Time will also expose the good things you didn’t know you had.

  

  

1. Time will eliminate things you have outgrown.

  

Somethings you don’t want anymore as they don’t mean what they used to mean.

E.G going through your wardrobe and throwing out old clothes as you outgrow it or don’t like it anymore or it’s not the style anymore.

We outgrow things because we mature and time and seasons change.

You don’t get all the clothes you will ever wear in one moment. No you wait till you get to that size then put new ones on.

The bible says (Put away childish ways, but remain childlike) also says you are a child of God so put away things you have outgrown but be a child of God and know he’s your provider as you don’t outgrow God.

You cannot do anything to shorten Gods waiting times because He has it all planned out anyway.

  

1. Time will make the Good Great.

  

You don’t give a rifle to a 5 year old because they can kill themself.

The devil always over plays his hand and his mistake always comes to life.

  

Lots of people talk about what they’ve been through but not many people talk about WHAT THEY’VE BECOME.

A lot of people go through things but don’t become anything because they don’t like the pressure or are a victim.

It’s not the thing/trial that happened that caused you to become what you are now but it’s was GOD through the trial that made you become what you are now.

God is more concerned about my development than my comfort.

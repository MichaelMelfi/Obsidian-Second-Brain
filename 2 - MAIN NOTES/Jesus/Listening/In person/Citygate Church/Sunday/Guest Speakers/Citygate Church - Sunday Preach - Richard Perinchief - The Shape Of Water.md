##### What Did I Learn From This Teaching?:
- The graph of grace
   - the path to salvation is on a graph -10 to +10 When speaking to someone you do not have to get them from -10 to +10 (Saved). Every conversation, Sometimes the point of the conversation it just to get them from a -10 to a -5.
   - Stop being selfish and worrying about yourself when its others salvation on the line.
   - The water Of God flows through us. DO NOT BLOCK IT.
   - If you block it then it will not be able to flow to anyone else.
   - Water takes the shape of whatever it enters. Just speak to people and the water will fill the cracks of even things you cannot see in a person!

## How to use your job or hobby to help the kingdom of God

### Living Water
The Word of God is Inherent, inspiring and can shape us and change us

> “On the last day of the feast, the great day, Jesus stood up and cried out, “If anyone thirsts, let him come to me and drink. Whoever believes in me, as the Scripture has said, ‘Out of his heart will flow rivers of living water.’””
> “Now this he said about the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were to receive, for as yet the Spirit had not been given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.”
‭‭==John‬ ‭7‬:‭37‬-‭39 ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/jhn.7.37-38.ESV

Different translations
Some say, out of his womb or out of his core comes living water.

> “Jesus answered her, “If you knew the gift of God, and who it is that is saying to you, ‘Give me a drink,’ you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.””
‭‭==John‬ ‭4‬:‭10‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/jhn.4.10.ESV

> “Do you see a man skillful in his work? He will stand before kings; he will not stand before obscure men.”
‭‭==Proverbs‬ ‭22‬:‭29‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/pro.22.29.ESV

### Let The River Flow

Gods glory needs to flow like a river of living water.

> “Then he brought me back to the door of the temple, and behold, water was issuing from below the threshold of the temple toward the east (for the temple faced east). The water was flowing down from below the south end of the threshold of the temple, south of the altar.”
‭‭==Ezekiel‬ ‭47‬:‭1‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/ezk.47.1.ESV
(Read the rest of this chapter up to verse 12)
This chapter talks about a vision from an angel of flooding into the temple which gets larger and larger which consumes the temple, the people of god, the house of god then to the trees etc.
It says everywhere this water goes, it brings life.
And the water always flows through the church first.

Your connection to the house of God is imperative to the water flowing.

The bible speaks of the phrase living water over 100 times.

One of waters unique qualities is that is has no shape.
Left to its own devises it can seep into any crack, fill any space.
It’s shape is only limited by its container.

Paul writes we are vessels of God
This is meaning we are vessels/containers for the liquid/water/glory of God.


Everyone is in the ministry together but everyone has different roles.
Not everyone has to be a preacher or evangelist.
We need more people in the world spreading the gospel than people on a platform!

We are the salt of the earth!
Salt dries things up and makes you need water!
We must be ready to share the gospel and make people want the water of God!

This is the same as being blessed to be a blessing.
God blesses you to get to other people!
You are just a vessel for the water of God and you’ve got to make sure that you do not bottle it up or cause a damn in the river.
You must keep letting it flow!
If you block the river then the whole river will dry up and create a route around you!

If you don’t open your mouth (The mouth of the river) Then it cannot flow.
You must open your mouth and talk to others!

Jesus is the fountain of life.

To many times we are too worried about how we pour the water into others.
Water does what it wants and flows how it wants.
No matter how to pour it will take shape and find the cracks itself.
Even the cracks you cannot see with your own eyes!

Too many people think they have to talk to someone and get them from nothing to saved every time!
The scale of grace is important.
Your reason for speaking to someone might not be for you to get them from 0 to a 10 in that conversation.
But that conversation might have only been for you to get them from a 0 to a 1 and start the chain to get them to a 10

Stop blocking the river and worrying about yourself.
You are doing it for them

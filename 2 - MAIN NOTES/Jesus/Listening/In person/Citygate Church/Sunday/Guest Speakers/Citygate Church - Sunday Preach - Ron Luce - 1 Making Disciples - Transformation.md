TRANSFORMATION

  

Matthew 7:24-27

““Anyone who listens to my teaching and follows it is wise, like a person who builds a house on solid rock. Though the rain comes in torrents and the floodwaters rise and the winds beat against that house, it won’t collapse because it is built on bedrock. But anyone who hears my teaching and doesn’t obey it is foolish, like a person who builds a house on sand. When the rains and floods come and the winds beat against that house, it will collapse with a mighty crash.””

Matthew 28- go make disciples

  

What is a disciple?

‘The life long persist of becoming more like Jesus by learning from him and experiencing his reality’

  

Are we fans or followers?

A fan only likes them when there is something in it for them

A follower likes them and trust them no matter what happens

  

Acts 11:26

Acts 13:52

Acts 14:

  

Matthew 23:1 Then Jesus said to the crowds AND his disciples

This shows that not everyone who listening to Jesus or is in church or in a crowd is a disciple.

  

Transformation

Process of transformation

- Character
- Renewing mind
- Freedom from habits to stay free
- Building good name
- Wholesome relationship

  

It says 32 times in the bible ‘follow me’

  

So why do we talk about accepting Jesus into our life instead of Following God in alter calls.

  

A lot of the time when we talk about follow me, we expect Jesus to walk with us through our life but it should be up walking with Jesus into a new life!

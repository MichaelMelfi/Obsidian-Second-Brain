# Citygate Church - Sunday Preach - Richard Perinchief - The Battle For Dynamic Worship
THE BATTLE FOR DYNAMIC WORSHIP

  

It’s not about your choice of expression or where you do it. Worship is about 

“God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth.”“

‭‭John‬ ‭4‬:‭24‬ ‭NKJV‬‬

  

When you worship you are a threat to hell

  

God can fill every empty vessel you give him but you have to give him the empty vessel in the first place.

  

- 1. Don’t go too far

The devil is trying to stop us going too far as worship was his job in heaven and he got kicked out but now God has made us be able to worship so we took his job and everything we wanted.

  

If poverty is so holy then why does God live in wealth.

  

You cannot worship without sacrifice.

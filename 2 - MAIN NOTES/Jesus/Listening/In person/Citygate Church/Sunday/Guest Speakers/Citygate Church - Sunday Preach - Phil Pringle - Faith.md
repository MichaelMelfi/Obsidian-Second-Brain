Jesus picked up His cross for you.

You have to take the next step and pick up your cross for Jesus.

|A Perpetual Covenant of Peace<br><br>1 ¶ “Sing, O barren, <br><br>You who have not borne!<br><br>Break forth into singing, and cry aloud,<br><br>You who have not labored with child!<br><br>For more are the children of the desolate<br><br>Than the children of the married woman,” says the LORD.|there is power in praise. Do not let the devil steal your song. That’s why God tells you to SING. Thankfulness is the language of concorers. SING O BARREN. If you stop singing then it gives satan a crack for him to slip into your life that’s why he always tries to silence you.|
|2 “Enlarge the place of your tent,<br><br>And let them stretch out the curtains of your dwellings;<br><br>Do not spare;<br><br>Lengthen your cords,<br><br>And strengthen your stakes.|leg THEM stretch out the curtains. It is the churches responsibility to grow the church not the pastors. We do not grow without stretching.|
|3 For you shall expand to the right and to the left,<br><br>And your descendants will inherit the nations,<br><br>And make the desolate cities inhabited.||

Do not let the devil steal your song.

  

When you have a faith atmosphere, Gods power travels in it.

  

Act today like you would while you have that thing in the future.

  

Just because your prayer isn’t answered the first time doesn’t mean it’s not the will of God.

  

You generally fail more times at the thing you are good at than you succeed.

  

Praise is faith vocalised.

  

You must organise your atmosphere. If you feel depressed, SING. 

If you have a problem with your children, go to their room and praise in there. 

  

A problem is never the problem, your attitude to the problem is the problem. 

A problem is an opportunity for a victory to come.

  

You sing today like you’ve already got what you’re singing about.

  

If you walk in faith you will ALWAYS collide with a miracle.

  

God says things as if they were.

God can talk into your future as if it is your past as he already sees your as what he wants.

  

Do not spare anything!

Our biggest regret is that we haven’t emptied our whole quiver every time we can do.

That when God has asked us to shoot 6 arrows we only shoot 3.

|Four Fishermen Called as Disciples<br><br>([Matt. 4:18-22](blb://pericope/nkjv/Matt.%204:18-22); [Mark 1:16-20](blb://pericope/nkjv/Mark%201:16-20) )<br><br>1 ¶ So it was, as the multitude pressed about Him to hear the word of God, that He stood by the Lake of Gennesaret,|
|2 and saw two boats standing by the lake; but the fishermen had gone from them and were washing their nets.|
|3 Then He got into one of the boats, which was Simon’s, and asked him to put out a little from the land. And He sat down and taught the multitudes from the boat.|
|4 ¶ When He had stopped speaking, He said to Simon, “Launch out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch.”|
|5 ¶ But Simon answered and said to Him, “Master, we have toiled all night and caught nothing; nevertheless at Your word I will let down the net.”|
|6 And when they had done this, they caught a great number of fish, and their net was breaking.|
|7 So they signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them. And they came and filled both the boats, so that they began to sink.|
|8 When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus’ knees, saying, “Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord!”|

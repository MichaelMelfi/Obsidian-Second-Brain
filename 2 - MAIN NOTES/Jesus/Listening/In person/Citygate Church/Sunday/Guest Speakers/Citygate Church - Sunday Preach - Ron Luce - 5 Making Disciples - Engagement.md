Mark 1:35

Luke 11:1

  

3 Ways of relationship

Non-Conscious relationship

People come to the presence of God and get goosebumps but go back home and leave it at church.

  

  

Semi-Conscious Relationship

Luke 10:41-42

  

Just like talking to parents, you are doing things but trying to listen to them while EG on your phone.

Saying you’re listening but you actually aren’t

  

  

Fully-Conscious Relationship

John 20:1-16

Jesus had told them so many times that he will die and rise again but when He died and the body was gone, they thought the enemy took it!

  

She is literally talking to Jesus and didn’t know it.

You can be in the presence of God and not know it.

You can be so close but still complaining about things Jesus has already sorted.

  

She says they have moved his body 3 times before realising it was Him!

She only realised it was Him when He said her NAME

  

Have you heard Him call your name LATELY?

When did you last hear Him call your name?

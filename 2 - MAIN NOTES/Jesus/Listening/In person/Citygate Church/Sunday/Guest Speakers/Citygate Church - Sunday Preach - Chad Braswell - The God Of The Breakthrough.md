Matthew 8:1-17 Jesus cleanses the leper

  

It is faith that moves God.

You need Faith with Feet that keeps moving forward.

Faith is a verb meaning it is a doing word.

  

- 1. Sometimes all we need is a touch from Jesus.

  

The lady with the flowing blood touched his garment.

He touched the leper and he was healed.

  

Sometimes you just have to go to Jesus not wait for people to pray for you and agree with you.

  

- 2. Sometimes all we need is a word from Jesus

  

Sometimes the word we need is the one we don’t want. It’s time to take him at his word and push your wants aside and follow what he says.

  

You might be waiting on Jesus to give you a word but you probably haven’t put action into the one he last gave you.

  

- 3. Sometimes we need a friend who will go to Jesus for us

  

Sometimes we need to be the friend to go to Jesus for them and stop asking our friends to do it for you as what you sow you reap.

  

We need friends that will bring you to Jesus like the ones who let down the leper into the house.

  

Clarity is kindness.

  

It’s not the pastors responsibility to get your friends saved. You have to be praying and preaching to them not just inviting and hoping.

  

- 4. We are all called to bring all people to Jesus

  

1 can put 100 to flight but 2 can put 10,000 to flight.

  

How amazing would it be if you got to heaven and people come up to you saying that through you they heard about God or through you who then told someone else.

  

We should see talking to people about Jesus and get them saved as an inconvenience, but as a miracle we will be apart of.

  

Some people don’t talk about Jesus because they live like hell.

The more you talk about Jesus the more you want to be like him.

  

We don’t just pray for people but to bring people.

  

We are called to be ambassadors of Christ.

  

Matthew 28-18-20

Go and make disciples of all nations.

  

If you don’t talk about Jesus, how important is he to you as out of your mouth comes your heart.

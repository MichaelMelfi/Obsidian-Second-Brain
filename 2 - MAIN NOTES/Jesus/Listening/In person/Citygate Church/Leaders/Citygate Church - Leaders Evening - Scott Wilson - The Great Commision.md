# Citygate Church - Leaders Evening - Scott Wilson - The Great Commision
Matthew 28:16-20 NLT

“Then the eleven disciples left for Galilee, going to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go. When they saw him, they worshiped him—but some of them doubted! Jesus came and told his disciples, “I have been given all authority in heaven and on earth. Therefore, go and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. Teach these new disciples to obey all the commands I have given you. And be sure of this: I am with you always, even to the end of the age.””

What Jesus is talking about

  

POWER

‘All authority has been given to me….therefore….’

This is power and authority

  

Jesus transferred the power into our lives when he rose again.

we become the authority in what God wants us to do.

  

It’s like a policeman.

He can stop traffic but only because of him authority as a policeman and the uniform he is wearing but doesn’t have the power to physically stop the car.

  

Every gift from God is a power gift, he gifts us the power to be able to do something to do what He wants us to do.

Power to prophesy, power to preach.

You are involved with every single person that gets baptised in your church. Whether that’s being on the door, coffees, stacking chairs, everyone plays a part.

  

Baptism into His death - Romans 6:3

The water is a grave and you come into a new life.

You die to yourself.

What do you want to leave in the water? 

What is now dead to you?

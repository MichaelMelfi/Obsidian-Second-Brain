# The Tab - Sunday Preach - Prayer
Prayer and fasting


- Worship:

Started off looking like they were bored but by the end very very engaging.

Musicians all sit down.

All in jeans and white tops

Was full by the end of the praise and worship. 1 hour later.

Everyone has a mic, musicians.

  

They do the same announcements twice. 

  

Baptism in His name? Talking about Jesus.

  

- Offering:

Acts 20:35

It is more blessed to give than receive.

  

Just the verse and that’s it.

Have to walk to the front with your offering and they get everyone to walk from their seats all around the chairs.

  

A lot of holding hands and praying.

  

- Preach:

His wife preached, he wasn’t there

Hand held mics

Some Stuart’s still wearing masks

  

Luke 18:1-7

Luke 11:5- 9

Why would u not use a power tool if that’s the thing that works the best

Same with prayer.

You cannot be in the presence of God and not change. Everything around you has to change when you pray.

  

When you are are driving a car you POM

Prepare, observe then move.

Same with God

  

1. Prepare

You prepare for what is coming and what you want God to do for you.

  

You wouldn’t go to King Charles not prepared with what you want to say 

Same with God, he is the King of Kings so you must prepare for what you will say and what he will do

  

How do you see prayer?

Prayer is us lining ourselves with God

How can we know what God wants if we don’t communicate with him.

  

1. Mirror

When you get into someone else’s car you can’t ever use the mirrors how they position it, you have to position it for your height etc.

This is like your life you can’t just get in someone else life or in their shoes, you have to position and observe how it fits with you.

  

God is meant to be seen through you, you are meant to be like Jesus/a mirror image.

  

1. observe

Observe what is around you, see what he has done for you already and is doing for you.

The devil is trying his hardest to make you believe that God is great and make you forget what he had already done for you.

  

If you don’t study the Bible you won’t be able to handle certain challenges as you won’t know the  answers/instructions to get through it Gods way.

  

1. Signal/Indicate

You signal so people around you and behind you know where you’re going.

We need to indicate to God, the enemy and also people around us.

  

  

1. Move

Move how God has told you to and move towards what he wants for you.

It doesn’t matter if you are on your own, just do it, however, you are not alone God, Jesus and the Holy Spirit is always with you.

  

Jesus isn’t the back seat driver, he is the one who has the wheel.

  

Was saying we need to steal back joy etc,

we already have it!!!!

Jesus was telling the disciples about revelations He has had.
They had the communion for the first time this night.
Then ends it with this.

> “Dear children, I will be with you only a little longer. And as I told the Jewish leaders, you will search for me, but you can’t come where I am going. So now I am giving you a new commandment: Love each other. Just as I have loved you, you should love each other. Your love for one another will prove to the world that you are my disciples.””
‭‭==John‬ ‭13‬:‭33‬-‭35‬ ‭NLT‬‬==

> “looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith, who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.”
‭‭==Hebrews‬ ‭12‬:‭2‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/heb.12.2.NKJV

What was the joy?
Knowing that me and everyone else would be saved, set free


Why as followers of Christ do we endure more hardship than everyone else in the world?

Because the enemy is coming for us.

The enemy will keep sending opposition to you to make you stop.


The disciples knew they would go through these times of hardship.
Jesus even said that the religious people of that time would put the disciples to death and they did.
That is hard times.

But do not worry!
Jesus has won.

> “These things I have spoken to you, that in Me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.””
‭‭==John‬ ‭16‬:‭33‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/jhn.16.33.NKJV

And He is the one that lives in us!

> “But if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who dwells in you.”
‭‭==Romans‬ ‭8‬:‭11‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/rom.8.11.NKJV

But even Jesus was hated and engured hardship.

> ““If the world hates you, you know that it hated Me before it hated you.”
‭‭==John‬ ‭15‬:‭18‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/jhn.15.18.NKJV

But even then, even with everyone hating Him, he still said on the cross

> ““For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.”
‭‭==Matthew‬ ‭6‬:‭14‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/mat.6.14.NKJV

Story about hardship and endurance.


> “So shall they fear The name of the Lord from the west, And His glory from the rising of the sun; When the enemy comes in like a flood, The Spirit of the Lord will lift up a standard against him.”
‭‭==Isaiah‬ ‭59‬:‭19‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/isa.59.19.NKJV

When you endure hardship, you are being prepared for leadership.
Keep the joy set before you.
When you endure hardship, you are being prepared for reining with Him.

> “If we endure, We shall also reign with Him. If we deny Him, He also will deny us.”
‭‭==II Timothy‬ ‭2‬:‭12‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/2ti.2.12.NKJV

This is why in the New Testament it tells us to “encourage each other daily”
So we are not singled out and on our own, but in a group and able to stand your ground with people helping you.

When you endure you get a promotion in the spirit realm as Jesus can trust you with others and His children. (Children of God)

So next time something happens like your tire goes flat or a tree falls on your car.
Count it with Joy, 
He that is in you is greater than he that is in the world.

These are temporary hardship.

David got through his hardship into a song and wrote about it.
This is the book of psalms.
Every hardship he had he made into a song and a testimony.
Even if he didn’t go too good.
He still made sure joy and praise was his first thing.

We have over come the accuser which is Satan.
And this was overcome by the blood of the lamb.

You cannot have a testimony if you haven’t been through some hardship.
Everyone has been through hardship

But Jesus went through the worst hardship and He lives in us. So we have over come all already.

If I did not have a testimony there is no reason for you to believe me.
I can tell you this because of going through hardship.
That I have been at the lowest and got out with God
How God got me out of the pit I was in and helped me overcome it.

And He will do the same as you.

You’ve got to encourage people to help them.
You sing songs with them
You look out for the 1 and talk to them
You look for someone who is sad and pray for them.
If you see something that is wrong, maybe you notice someone is sad.
You have received an assignment from God to help them.
You strengthen them and remind them who they are.

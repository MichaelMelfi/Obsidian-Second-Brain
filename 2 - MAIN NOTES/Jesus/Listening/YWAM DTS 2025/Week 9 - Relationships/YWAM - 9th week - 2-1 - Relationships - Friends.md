# YWAM - 9th week - 2-1 - Relationships - Friends


Before God gave Adam a wife he first had to walk with God and have a relationship with God.

> “By his divine power, God has given us everything we need for living a godly life. We have received all of this by coming to know him, the one who called us to himself by means of his marvelous glory and excellence. And because of his glory and excellence, he has given us great and precious promises. These are the promises that enable you to share his divine nature and escape the world’s corruption caused by human desires.”
==‭‭2 Peter‬ ‭1‬:‭3‬-‭4‬ ‭NLT‬‬==

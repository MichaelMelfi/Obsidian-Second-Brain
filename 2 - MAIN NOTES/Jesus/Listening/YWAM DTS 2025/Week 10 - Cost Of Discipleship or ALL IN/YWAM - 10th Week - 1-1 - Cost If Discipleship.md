## Your calling and faithful with little
Since the beginning of creation God has had a call on your life.
People have been dreaming and praying for your call
God has been dreaming for your call.

God wants to bring his good news to the nation but we must be the ones to steward that.

If you are faithful with the little, he will trust you with much.
You must pass your test so you can move to the next one.
Once you get to the next test or next calling you cannot make excuses because you are busy.
It starts with picking up rubbish or little things like that.
Ask Him to give you little tasks, and the tasks will get bigger and bigger.
### Matthew, die to yourself
==Matthew‬ ‭16‬:‭24‬-‭27‬ ‭NLT‬‬==
> “Then Jesus said to his disciples, “If any of you wants to be my follower, you must give up your own way, take up your cross, and follow me. If you try to hang on to your life, you will lose it. But if you give up your life for my sake, you will save it. And what do you benefit if you gain the whole world but lose your own soul? Is anything worth more than your soul? For the Son of Man will come with his angels in the glory of his Father and will judge all people according to their deeds.”
https://bible.com/bible/116/mat.16.24-27.NLT

Whenever you see the word if in the bible, because if there is an if it is because it is a conditional statement.
It means you have a choice.

There are a lot of people who are FANS of Jesus but not Mann who are FOLLOWERS.
This means they go to church but when they get home they are their own Lord of their life and not Jesus.
The world is telling people that everything you want you should have it and take it.
But Jesus tells the complete opposite. It says to make a choice and choose me over everything you want.

DEATH TO YOUR OWN WANTS AND PLAN
LIFE TO GODS WANTS AND PLANS
AW Milner to the New Hebrides. When he went on his mission trip, he and his team literally packed their coffins because they knew they were not coming back.
He went to an island that no one came from alive because the people who lived there always killed them.
He ended up living there 30 years and died. On the tomb stone that the islanders did said.
“When he came there was no light
When he left there was no darkness”



“Jesus did not die to keep us safe
But died to make us dangerous”
However the safest place in the world is in his obedience because God is the safest place.

## The gospel of Mark
The gospel of Mark is all about lordship, all in.

> “This is the Good News about Jesus the Messiah, the Son of God. It began”
‭‭==Mark‬ ‭1‬:‭1‬ ‭NLT‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/116/mrk.1.1.NLT
To fully understand this verse you need to know the history.
The problem with Christian’s today is they do not know the bible, they do not fully know the word of god, they do not know their own sword!

Who is mark??
Acts 12:12 - part of the original church
Acts 11:25 - mark goes on outreach with Paul
Acts 13:13 - mark fails and has to go back home.
His story starts with failure.
The most important thing when you fail is that you do not give up and keep going
> “For a righteous man may fall seven times And rise again, But the wicked shall fall by calamity.”
‭‭==Proverbs‬ ‭24‬:‭16‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/pro.24.16.NKJV
God does not worry about your failures.
It’s only Satan who cares about your fails!

- Acts 15:36 - a Paul and Barbara’s argue over Mark
Paul does not want Mark as he failed last time
Barnabas wants Mark and encourages Mark!
- 2 Timothy 4:11 - Paul calls for Mark
He admits he was wrong!
- 1 Peter 5:13 - Peter calls Mark “his son”
Peter then called for mark as-well as they knew how important he was.


During the time of Jesus the Roman Empire rules everything and Rome has these kings.
These kings were seen as the son of God

1. Tiberius 14-37 AD (ruler during Jesus)
- He kicked out all the Jews and Egyptians from Rome.
- He loved his wife so much that he married his wife’s mum aswell!
- He killed his own son
- He was drunk all the time 
- Greed

1. Caligula 37-41 AD
- he tried to get the Jews to worship him
- He declared his horse as God
- Wore woman’s clothes
- Cut off the heads of Greek gods statues and replaced it with his head. This was no small thing, there were 30,000 idols in one city!

1. Claudius 41-54 AD
- he kicked out the Jewish people in Acts 2
- Known for gluttony and drunkenness
- His 1st decree was to make his grandma a god
- Killed by his wife Agrippina this was because they adopted a son called Nero and the wife wanted him to be king more than her husband.

1. Nero 41-54 AD
- king at 17, very smart
- Made coins of himself
- Neronian games (like Olympics)
- married a little boy
- Known as a thief
- He asked the sender for a bigger house because he thought it was too small for him, the senet said no 
- so Nero ordered a fire to be started and it was uncontrollable for 1 week.
- He then blamed it on Christian’s and then the persecution of the Christian’s started.
- The Christian’s were being put into the stadium and fed to lions.
- He would cover Christian’s in wax, tie them up and set them on fire at his house during his parties.

This then comes back to 
> “This is the Good News about Jesus the Messiah, the Son of God. It began”
‭‭==Mark‬ ‭1‬:‭1‬ ‭NLT‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/116/mrk.1.1.NLT

Mark is telling the Romans church that Jesus has come for you! That you shall be saved!


Paul and Peter were killed during the time of the persecution under Nero

They cut off Paul’s head
They crucified Peter upside down because he said he is not worthy to die in the same was as his saviour.

Then this is where Mark 1:1 comes in
After all of this.
The Christian nation have seen that Paul and Peter who were the most important people in the church died on the same day.
So mark comes out with talking about the Good news of Jesus.

Now when a new king of Ceasre came to power they would go through the cities and proclaim
“The beginning of the good news of (the kings name) the son of God”

But after all of what has happened with Peter and Paul.
Mark then calls out Nero saying you are not God!

> “The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.”
‭‭==Mark‬ ‭1‬:‭1‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/mrk.1.1.NKJV

He proclaimed that Nero was not the king or God but Jesus was!


> “As it is written in the Prophets: “Behold, I send My messenger before Your face, Who will prepare Your way before You.” “The voice of one crying in the wilderness: ‘Prepare the way of the Lord; Make His paths straight.’ ””
‭‭==Mark‬ ‭1‬:‭2‬-‭3‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/mrk.1.2-3.NKJV

This Is linking with 
This is talking about how to prepare for the king.

> “The voice of one crying in the wilderness: “Prepare the way of the Lord; Make straight in the desert A highway for our God.”
‭‭==Isaiah‬ ‭40‬:‭3‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/isa.40.3.NKJV
> “Every valley shall be exalted And every mountain and hill brought low; The crooked places shall be made straight And the rough places smooth; The glory of the Lord shall be revealed, And all flesh shall see it together; For the mouth of the Lord has spoken.””
‭‭==Isaiah‬ ‭40‬:‭4‬-‭5‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/isa.40.4-5.NKJV
> “The voice said, “Cry out!” And he said, “What shall I cry?” “All flesh is grass, And all its loveliness is like the flower of the field. The grass withers, the flower fades, Because the breath of the Lord blows upon it; Surely the people are grass. The grass withers, the flower fades, But the word of our God stands forever.” O Zion, You who bring good tidings, Get up into the high mountain; O Jerusalem, You who bring good tidings, Lift up your voice with strength, Lift it up, be not afraid; Say to the cities of Judah, “Behold your God!””
‭‭==Isaiah‬ ‭40‬:‭6‬-‭9‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/isa.40.6-9.NKJV

How to prepare for the king?

1. Lift up your voice and cry out.
Shout, do not be quiet!
2. Fear God not man
You must kill the fear of man or the fear of man in your life will kill the call of god on your life.
3. Pasture yourself on a high mountain
When you meet a king in Thailand you have to greet him on your knees.
You must posture your life to meet God.

> “John came baptizing in the wilderness and preaching a baptism of repentance for the remission of sins. Then all the land of Judea, and those from Jerusalem, went out to him and were all baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins. Now John was clothed with camel’s hair and with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey.”
‭‭==Mark‬ ‭1‬:‭4‬-‭6‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/mrk.1.4-6.NKJV

A radical response.
THE WHOLE COUNTRY WENT TO SEE JOHN THE BAPTISED.
How do you respond to the king?
It must be a radical response with the whole country going all in.
Why did they all go out?
In the Old Testament God spoke through prophets but for 400 years where god was not speaking through anyone. there has been no prophets.
John the baptised is the first one since then, everyone is excited that GOD IS SPEAKING AGAIN.
Jews do not get baptised it was usually only gentiles however THE WHOLE COUNTRY WENT TO SEE BECAUSE GOD IS SPEAKING AGAIN.
But they then all got baptised.


> “And he preached, saying, “There comes One after me who is mightier than I, whose sandal strap I am not worthy to stoop down and loose. I indeed baptized you with water, but He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.””
‭‭==Mark‬ ‭1‬:‭7‬-‭8‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/mrk.1.8.NKJV

John the baptised is the example of going ALL IN.
He is the most famous person at the moment yet he said he is not worthy enough to even take off Jesus’ sandals.
In this time, slaves would wash the masters feet but it was seen as so low for someone to take off someone’s sandles that even slaves didn’t remove the masters sandles.
Yet he is saying I AM NOT WORTHY to even unity the sandles of JESUS

He said I am not worthy because Peter said I am not worthy and he knew that the whole church knew what Peter had been saying so he made sure that everyone knew this is how to greet the king.

1 kings 19:

> “And Jehu the son of Nimshi you shall anoint to be king over Israel, and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah you shall anoint to be prophet in your place.”
‭‭==1 Kings‬ ‭19‬:‭16‬ ‭ESV‬‬==

Where is Abel-meholah?
This is where some of the best farm land is in Abel-meholah.

> “So he departed from there and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who was plowing with his twelve yoke of oxen in front of him, and he was with the twelfth. Elijah passed by him and cast his cloak upon him.”
==‭‭1 Kings‬ ‭19‬:‭19‬ ‭ESV‬‬==

His cloak is a mantle.

> “And he left the oxen and ran after Elijah and said, “Let me kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow you.” And he said to him, “Go back again, for what have I done to you?” And he returned from following him and took the yoke of oxen and sacrificed them and boiled their flesh with the yokes of the oxen and gave it to the people, and they ate. Then he arose and went after Elijah and assisted him.”
‭‭==1 Kings‬ ‭19‬:‭20‬-‭21‬ ‭ESV‬‬==

This is Elisha sacrificing everything.
Going ALL IN

## What does Jesus tell us to lay down?
### Future plans and desires
This is where Jesus asked the disciples to lay down their nets, the nets were their future and plans for their life.
The nets were their security, provider and life as they were fishermen.

> “Passing alongside the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew the brother of Simon casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen. And Jesus said to them, “Follow me, and I will make you become fishers of men.” And immediately they left their nets and followed him. And going on a little farther, he saw James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, who were in their boat mending the nets. And immediately he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants and followed him.”
‭‭==Mark‬ ‭1‬:‭16‬-‭20‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/mrk.1.16-20.ESV

Jesus did not make them change what they were doing but change what they were catching
He will use your strengths to help Him.

- John and James are with their dad and they had hired men working with them meaning they were successful at fishing.
- When a father finishes their life, the business always goes to the son but they drop everything, even their parents plans for them.
- The father would have built this business his whole life, he built it for them to pick it up but they are leaving everything for a Jewish rabbi who is homeless.
- How do you think the parents would have felt!


Context:
Jesus was invited to a Pharisees house, these were very spiritual men and it would have most likely only been men there.
> “One of the Pharisees asked him to eat with him, and he went into the Pharisee’s house and reclined at table.”
‭‭==Luke‬ ‭7‬:‭36‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/luk.7.36.ESV

> “And behold, a woman of the city, who was a sinner, when she learned that he was reclining at table in the Pharisee’s house, brought an alabaster flask of ointment, and standing behind him at his feet, weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears and wiped them with the hair of her head and kissed his feet and anointed them with the ointment. Now when the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said to himself, “If this man were a prophet, he would have known who and what sort of woman this is who is touching him, for she is a sinner.””
‭‭==Luke‬ ‭7‬:‭37‬-‭39‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/luk.7.37-39.ESV

Her being called a sinner is most likely her being a prostitute which means that in those days it was such a sin that she should actually be stoned by the people in the house she has gone into.
She is risking her life.
She was so so bold to role up into the Pharisees house in the middle of their dinner with only men there and she comes in and break her alabaster vase which is worth a lot of money. You cannot open and close this vase, once opened it would be opened forever.
Most likely it was passed down through her family.
Most likely a family and financial security.
It’s all she has from her past and most likely all she has for her future
But she break the jar at His feet
She went all in

God is asking, no matter what your past is and no matter what your future will be, will you break it at His feet and go all in and trust Him with everything.

### Lay down our reputation
> “And a leper came to him, imploring him, and kneeling said to him, “If you will, you can make me clean.” Moved with pity, he stretched out his hand and touched him and said to him, “I will; be clean.” And immediately the leprosy left him, and he was made clean.”
‭‭==Mark‬ ‭1‬:‭40‬-‭42‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/mrk.1.40-42.ESV

Jesus didn’t care about His reputation.
All of the laws in the Old Testament are about being clean and not mixing with the unclean.
But Jesus goes against this, he sees a need and no matter the situation he played down his reputation and what was normal at that time to help.
This ruins His reputation, He should not be anywhere near the leper.
Other rabbis even if a leper went on a road, the rabbis wouldn’t want to go on the same road.
But Jesus didn’t just go close to him He actually touched the leper.
From the lepers point of view, he would have most likely not been touched by a human since he had leperacy, so Jesus didn’t just heal the leperacy, before the healing, he touched the leper which would have healed him emotionally first from having the touch from another human then he was healed physically.

### Finances, Wealth, Status and Stuff
> “He went out again beside the sea, and all the crowd was coming to him, and he was teaching them. And as he passed by, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax booth, and he said to him, “Follow me.” And he rose and followed him.”
‭‭==Mark‬ ‭2‬:‭13‬-‭14‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/mrk.2.13-14.ESV

John and James were called from the sea. 
They came back to where they started.

Everyone hated tax collectors, because they would steal the money from the people and give it to the Romans.

Levi was the tax collector when John and James would have been at the fishing company and he would have been their tax collector their whole life.

 Think about how John and James would have felt, they would have hated Levi and didn’t see the potential and how he could become Matthew.
 Sometimes we can only see a Levi because of what they have done to us or who they are but Jesus sees a Matthew who can change the world and write a book of the Bible.
 Levi had success, money and a future but lays it all down and dies to his old self and becomes Matthew who is the opposite.
### Family 
> “Then he went home, and the crowd gathered again, so that they could not even eat. And when his family heard it, they went out to seize him, for they were saying, “He is out of his mind.””
‭‭==Mark‬ ‭3‬:‭20‬-‭21‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/mrk.3.20-21.ESV

Jesus goes back to His home town.
All of these people have come from Jerusalem and cannot even eat so start saying Jesus is crazy.

It will then go on to say that the people say Jesus has a demon.

This is a small village so if people talk around the village, everyone is talking and the whole village is now against Jesus.
Jesus’ family is embarrassed of Him and tried to get Him to stop and go back into His house.

> “And his mother and his brothers came, and standing outside they sent to him and called him. And a crowd was sitting around him, and they said to him, “Your mother and your brothers are outside, seeking you.” And he answered them, “Who are my mother and my brothers?” And looking about at those who sat around him, he said, “Here are my mother and my brothers! For whoever does the will of God, he is my brother and sister and mother.””
‭‭==Mark‬ ‭3‬:‭31‬-‭35‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/mrk.3.31-35.ESV

> “Now when Jesus saw a crowd around him, he gave orders to go over to the other side. And a scribe came up and said to him, “Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.” And Jesus said to him, “Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.” Another of the disciples said to him, “Lord, let me first go and bury my father.” And Jesus said to him, “Follow me, and leave the dead to bury their own dead.””
‭‭==Matthew‬ ‭8‬:‭18‬-‭22‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/mat.8.18-22.ESV

In the original Hebrew, the man is actually saying, let me go back to by dad and look after him until he dies.
The man’s dad isn’t actually dead yet!

This is the same as so many people.
God I’m going to just go and do my own thing until I’m done then I will follow you fully!

### Marriage
The story of Hosea, Hosea most likely didn’t spend his life dreaming about marrying a prostitute. 
Lay down your desire for marriage.
It will probably not look like how you think.
Paul says that he has the spiritual gift of being single.
Lord if my life would bare more fruit single, then let me be single.
My wife and my kids are not mine they are the lords.
He has just trusted me to steward them.

Some people are in love with the idea of marriage not in love with the person they are getting married too.
Usually the longer you wait for something the more you will value that thing.

Before Eve became a person, Adam was told he would get a partner but first he had to name all the animals
This would have taken just the basic animals, one per second, about 100 years.
Adam had to wait about 100 years for Eve.

### Comfort
> “Not that I am speaking of being in need, for I have learned in whatever situation I am to be content. I know how to be brought low, and I know how to abound. In any and every circumstance, I have learned the secret of facing plenty and hunger, abundance and need. I can do all things through him who strengthens me.”
‭‭==Philippians‬ ‭4‬:‭11‬-‭13‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/php.4.11-13.ESV

I have learnt to be content in all things no matter what.
True comfort comes from Jesus.

### Control
You can’t control your life and your time
You can’t control others lives

The visual representation of imagining the passion of the Christ but installed of Jesus is should be me on that cross. It should be me getting whipped, it should be me being crucified.

Jesus will not tell you to do something he has not already done himself
> “Whatever is good and perfect is a gift coming down to us from God our Father, who created all the lights in the heavens. He never changes or casts a shifting shadow. He chose to give birth to us by giving us his true word. And we, out of all creation, became his prized possession.”
‭‭==James‬ ‭1‬:‭17‬-‭18‬ ‭NLT‬‬==

What are my dreams?
1. Have a family
2. Travel
3. Have loads of money
4. To be respected and seen as wise
5. But tbh anything that God wants me to do I will do

> ““My thoughts are nothing like your thoughts,” says the Lord. “And my ways are far beyond anything you could imagine. For just as the heavens are higher than the earth, so my ways are higher than your ways and my thoughts higher than your thoughts.”
‭‭==Isaiah‬ ‭55‬:‭8‬-‭9‬ ‭NLT‬‬==

> “In those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan. And when he came up out of the water, immediately he saw the heavens being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove. And a voice came from heaven, “You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased.””
‭‭==Mark‬ ‭1‬:‭9‬-‭11‬ ‭ESV‬‬==

In this verse, all 3 of the trinity are at work in this verse.
JESUS
SPIRIT
FATHER

Why a dove?
Could be because it symbolises peace.
Holiness?

The Roman Empire was ruling the world at this time.
The symbol of the romans was an eagle.
An eagle is a predictor and kills things

The Jews are wanting the son of God to come as a warrior to defeat the Romans.
Doves do not kill anything, doves get killed themselves.
So the Holy Spirit descended as a dove to be the complete opposite of what they wanted and be peace.
I’m not coming how you want me too.

This is how so many of us want to look like.
We want Jesus to be our worrier,
We want to be a fighter and worrier

But Jesus has different plans.
He is coming as the opposite of what you want.

Everyone wants to be like Jesus but he died, single, at 33 years old on a cross.
It is easy to say make me like Jesus but hard to act it out.
Die to self is easy to say but hard to do.

> “Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus, who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied himself, by taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men. And being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross.”
‭‭==Philippians‬ ‭2‬:‭5‬-‭8‬ ‭ESV‬‬==

Chapter 2:5
- have Jesus’ mind
- Be humble.
- be a symbol of peace and the opposite of the world.
- only wanting the fathers ways
- Following the father no matter what is happening around you or what other people want.
- You have Jesus’ mind. Let it be in you, it is asking you to allow it into you. It is a choice!
- Do not just look at it or read about it but let it manifest itself in you that it becomes part of you and how you automatically think.

Chapter 2:6
Humility

Chapter 2:7
Lay down His rights=like a slave
- humble yourself
- Take away your reputation and start fresh.
- Do not lean on other people’s success
- You must make your own reputation.
- Start low and work your way up.
- MADE himself, He MADE this happen it was His choice and His doing.

Chapter 2:8
Humility/obidience


### What is someone’s rights?
It is what someone deserves
It is something to which someone has just claim to

The wages of sin is  and every human has sin
So when Jesus died and went to hell he took the wage for us.
But also we die to ourselves which is also a payment of the wage.

## The Cross

### Who is Jesus?

Mark 14:60
> “And the high priest stood up in the midst and asked Jesus, “Have you no answer to make? What is it that these men testify against you?” But he remained silent and made no answer. Again the high priest asked him, “Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?””
‭‭==Mark‬ ‭14‬:‭60‬-‭61‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/mrk.14.60-61.ESV
They asked Him ARE YOU GOD?

And Jesus answered them

> “And Jesus said, “I am, and you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power, and coming with the clouds of heaven.””
‭‭==Mark‬ ‭14‬:‭62‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/mrk.14.62.ESV

He says I AM GOD I AM GOD I AM GOD

I AM
- Yahweh, God of the universe (Ex 3 and )
Son of Man
- OT divine figure from heaven and judge at the end
Seated at the right hand
- Place of supreme authority
Coming in the clouds
- OT judgment

Jesus Christ actually means in Hebrew:
Anointed one who saves.

So the high priest knew this was him saying I am the Christ 

> “And the high priest tore his garments and said, “What further witnesses do we need?”
‭‭==Mark‬ ‭14‬:‭63‬ ‭ESV‬‬==

### What is Crucifixion, the history.
Created by the Persians 500 years before Jesus.
The goal was to give the most pain and shame to someone in death.
With the most blood.
The goal was the publicly shame you.
Romans could not be put to death by crucifixion because it was so bad
After a man would be nailed to the cross you would actually suffocate to death because your lungs would fill up with liquid.
It was very slow and painful and that was the point.
They would have to push themselves up to be able to breath.
So if you’re were smart you wouldn’t push yourself back up.
They then stopped this by putting wood under their butts so they could not slouch.
There are crosses where there is a hole in between where the legs were and they think they might have nailed a man’s balls to the cross as-well.
They would do it in a very public place for everyone to see.
Most crosses would actually be small and not large like a lot of things show it is. so people could walk up to it and face the person and spit at them and do things to them.
Under the cross there would be blood, sweat, pee and poo because you were holding there so long.
Jesus was not the only one who died on the cross.
There was a battle and 6000 people got out on a cross in one day and lined them up 192km by the side of the road.

The bible talks the blood so so much in the bible
Jesus died on the cross to bleed out all of your sin.

### How did Jesus die?
Before he was on the cross
He was stripped down to almost naked.
Whipped with a cat of 9 tails.
These 9 things would be a mix between glass, hooks, nails and just anything to slice you up.
This was 40 times. Many people would die just from this. There are documents that say it would pull out ribs because it goes to deep.
In a way you could say he was sexually abused as he was whipped while naked infront of everyone
They then would lift him up and put the crown of thorns on his skull.
Then Jesus who used to be a carpenter get a slab of wood put on his back with would be about 80-90KG, he worked with wood His whole life and has to carry wood to His death.
Then Jesus who had hammered nails His whole life nah massive rail road nails hammered into his wrists.
The wrists are where the most nerves and veins connect in the body.
They would then lift up the cross with Him on it and drop it into the hole for the cross.

Then the Pharisees come and spit on Him and curse Him and he is the only one who does not respond.
The disciples have left Him
But all He says is 
“FATHER FORGIVE THEM FOR THEY DO NOT KNOW WHAT THEY DO”
All His words from the cross are words of love
He speaks to the robber on the cross 
“Today, You will be with me in paradise”
He says to John
“Take care of my mum I have been a good son.”

### what did Jesus accomplish on the Cross
1. Penal substitution atonement
HE DIED IN OUR PLACE
When you look at the cross you should say I should be on that cross
2. Christus Victor
Defeated the Devil, Demons and the death.
The spirit of Christ lives in us
The demons are scared of us!
[[Spiritual Warfare]]
3. For our freedom

4. New covenant sacrifice
As our sacrifice
The start of the new covenant
Negating the law of Moses so we do not need to sacrifice.
5. For our unrighteousness 
We are righteous
The great exchange, Jesus was sinless and righteous and gives that to us and takes our unrighteousness and sin.
6. Justification
To forgive you of your sin
Jesus is a just judge
We are guilty of sin
The only way Jesus can judge us is because he justifies us on the cross
You do not go to heaven because of good things but it’s only because of the good thing He did on the cross.
7. To take our wrath
Jesus was our propitiation
It says that God has wrath over our sin
The wrath of God is meant to be poured out on your because of your Sin.
But because of Jesus on the cross, the wrath of God is poured onto Him so it doesn’t get poured onto us.
8. Unlimited limited atonement
This means there is not a certain amount of people who get into heaven
He wants everyone to be saved but it is limited to those who believe.
9. Ransom
To pay your debt
Imagine you were 1,000,000 in debt and someone comes to you and pays your debt. You would do anything for them.
Jesus paid our debt of eternity in hell.
10. Christie’s exemplar
As an example of going all in and dieing to self
11. Expiation
To cleanse our filth
To wash us clean
12. Revelation
To reveal God
To get the revelation of what and who God is.

### What Jesus did on the Cross
Jesus didn’t just say he loved you.
He acted His love and showed it properly.
Love it serving and action.

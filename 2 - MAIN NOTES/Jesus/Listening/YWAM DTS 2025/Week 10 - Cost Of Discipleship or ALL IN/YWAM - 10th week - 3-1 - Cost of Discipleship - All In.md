Paul is writing to a man called Titus.
Titus lives on creat which is a very sinful place.
He probably wants to give up on his calling
And is reminding Titus that he is a slave of God and that he is one of Gods elect.
And that he is a doulos slave
We are gods elect, he has called us to something
We must remind ourselves to be a Titus.
We are Gods Elect and should be doulos slaves.

> “Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus - Christ, for the sake of the faith of God’s elect and their knowledge of the truth, which accords with godliness,”
‭‭==Titus‬ ‭1‬:‭1‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/tit.1.1.ESV

Why did he open it up with Paul, a servant of God?
Like Paul, God can you kill the pride in my life.

He is pouring into the next generation, Paul is such a busy person however he is willing to spend a long time talking to a insignificant man called Titus.

Servant = Doulos Slave - Exodus 21

Slaves were not a bad thing back in the days of the bible like the black slaves.
It means someone who works for a wealthy person.
More like a servant.

What is a Doulos Slave?:
It is a slave that serves for 6 years then after the 6 years, the servant then if he loves his master he will stay there for life and have his ear pierced to the masters door post.
It is a choice!
> “When you buy a Hebrew slave, he shall serve six years, and in the seventh he shall go out free, for nothing. If he comes in single, he shall go out single; if he comes in married, then his wife shall go out with him. If his master gives him a wife and she bears him sons or daughters, the wife and her children shall be her master’s, and he shall go out alone. But if the slave plainly says, ‘I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free,’ then his master shall bring him to God, and he shall bring him to the door or the doorpost. And his master shall bore his ear through with an awl, and he shall be his slave forever.”
‭‭==Exodus‬ ‭21‬:‭2‬-‭6‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/exo.21.2-6.ESV

Main things:
It is a permanent decision
- you cannot get that piece of your ear back.
It is public
- when you walk around people will see the hole and see that you are a doulos slave
Promised posture
- it is making that your identity. You are now and forever more a doulos slave.


Elect = is the word Ekelktos
Which is the word the general in the army would go and chose a commander
He would elect them
Once they were elect they were then given an assignment but it is the generals mission to make sure the mission is accomplished.
He would give him soldiers, food and anything he would need to complete the assignment.

Get a chair, who takes the seat on the throne of your life
Because a lot of Christian’s have God sitting on the throne on Sunday and the rest of the week you yourself is sitting on the throne 

If you are writing a letter and want someone to understand something then you will say something a lot of time
The word Saviour in the New Testament is used 24 times and in the whole bible 37 time
The word lord in the New testament is used 745 times and in the whole Bible 7,749

Reading from Luke 14:25-33

> “Now great crowds accompanied him, and he turned and said to them,”
‭‭==Luke‬ ‭14‬:‭25‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/luk.14.25.ESV
- He was with great crowds, he wasn’t asked about this it was something He came up with and thought that we must know Himself.
- He said it to a great crowd because everyone must know this, not only a select few.

> ““If anyone comes to me and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, yes, and even his own life, he cannot be my disciple.”
‭‭==Luke‬ ‭14‬:‭26‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/luk.14.26.

- IF - this is a choice! He is not forcing us.
- You must be against the world and hate the world and everything in it otherwise you cannot be His follower
- You are either against the world and with Him or for the world and against Him, you cannot be on the fence.
All the people He is talking to in this verse are Jewish as He is a Jewish rabbai.
The Old Testament says honour and love your mother and father.
The crowd would know He is not literally telling them to hate their mother and father but it is saying that God is number one in your life over everything.


> “Whoever does not bear his own cross and come after me cannot be my disciple.”
‭‭==Luke‬ ‭14‬:‭27‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/luk.14.27.ESV

- you must pick up your own cross, you must crucify you own wants and desires and nail them to the cross to be able to be free and follow Him.
- You must die a slow and painful death to yourself
- It’s not about you
- I have been crucified with Christ, it’s not I who loves but Christ who loves in me!

> “For which of you, desiring to build a tower, does not first sit down and count the cost, whether he has enough to complete it? Otherwise, when he has laid a foundation and is not able to finish, all who see it begin to mock him, saying, ‘This man began to build and was not able to finish.’ Or what king, going out to encounter another king in war, will not sit down first and deliberate whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand? And if not, while the other is yet a great way off, he sends a delegation and asks for terms of peace.”
‭‭==Luke‬ ‭14‬:‭28‬-‭32‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/luk.14.28-32.ESV

- you must know what you are getting into to follow Him it is not a light decision, this is a life time decision that you must see it all the way through to the end of the calling is complete.
- make sure you think first, and make sure you can see it the whole way!
- Emotions will not bring through until the end. 

> “So therefore, any one of you who does not renounce all that he has cannot be my disciple.”
‭‭==Luke‬ ‭14‬:‭33‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/luk.14.33.ESV

- you must give up everything/all.

Salvation is free but discipleship costs everything.
Salvation costs nothing because Jesus paid everything but your discipleship will cost everything.

It doesn’t say go and save people but it says to make DISCIPLES.

## What does Jesus tell us to lay down?
### Future plans and desires
This is where Jesus asked the disciples to lay down their nets, the nets were their future and plans for their life.
The nets were their security, provider and life as they were fishermen.

> “Passing alongside the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew the brother of Simon casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen. And Jesus said to them, “Follow me, and I will make you become fishers of men.” And immediately they left their nets and followed him. And going on a little farther, he saw James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, who were in their boat mending the nets. And immediately he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants and followed him.”
‭‭==Mark‬ ‭1‬:‭16‬-‭20‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/mrk.1.16-20.ESV

Jesus did not make them change what they were doing but change what they were catching
He will use your strengths to help Him.

- John and James are with their dad and they had hired men working with them meaning they were successful at fishing.
- When a father finishes their life, the business always goes to the son but they drop everything, even their parents plans for them.
- The father would have built this business his whole life, he built it for them to pick it up but they are leaving everything for a Jewish rabbi who is homeless.
- How do you think the parents would have felt!


Context:
Jesus was invited to a Pharisees house, these were very spiritual men and it would have most likely only been men there.
> “One of the Pharisees asked him to eat with him, and he went into the Pharisee’s house and reclined at table.”
‭‭==Luke‬ ‭7‬:‭36‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/luk.7.36.ESV

> “And behold, a woman of the city, who was a sinner, when she learned that he was reclining at table in the Pharisee’s house, brought an alabaster flask of ointment, and standing behind him at his feet, weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears and wiped them with the hair of her head and kissed his feet and anointed them with the ointment. Now when the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said to himself, “If this man were a prophet, he would have known who and what sort of woman this is who is touching him, for she is a sinner.””
‭‭==Luke‬ ‭7‬:‭37‬-‭39‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/luk.7.37-39.ESV

Her being called a sinner is most likely her being a prostitute which means that in those days it was such a sin that she should actually be stoned by the people in the house she has gone into.
She is risking her life.
She was so so bold to role up into the Pharisees house in the middle of their dinner with only men there and she comes in and break her alabaster vase which is worth a lot of money. You cannot open and close this vase, once opened it would be opened forever.
Most likely it was passed down through her family.
Most likely a family and financial security.
It’s all she has from her past and most likely all she has for her future
But she break the jar at His feet
She went all in

God is asking, no matter what your past is and no matter what your future will be, will you break it at His feet and go all in and trust Him with everything.

### Lay down our reputation
> “And a leper came to him, imploring him, and kneeling said to him, “If you will, you can make me clean.” Moved with pity, he stretched out his hand and touched him and said to him, “I will; be clean.” And immediately the leprosy left him, and he was made clean.”
‭‭==Mark‬ ‭1‬:‭40‬-‭42‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/mrk.1.40-42.ESV

Jesus didn’t care about His reputation.
All of the laws in the Old Testament are about being clean and not mixing with the unclean.
But Jesus goes against this, he sees a need and no matter the situation he played down his reputation and what was normal at that time to help.
This ruins His reputation, He should not be anywhere near the leper.
Other rabbis even if a leper went on a road, the rabbis wouldn’t want to go on the same road.
But Jesus didn’t just go close to him He actually touched the leper.
From the lepers point of view, he would have most likely not been touched by a human since he had leperacy, so Jesus didn’t just heal the leperacy, before the healing, he touched the leper which would have healed him emotionally first from having the touch from another human then he was healed physically.

### Finances, Wealth, Status and Stuff
> “He went out again beside the sea, and all the crowd was coming to him, and he was teaching them. And as he passed by, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax booth, and he said to him, “Follow me.” And he rose and followed him.”
‭‭==Mark‬ ‭2‬:‭13‬-‭14‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/mrk.2.13-14.ESV

John and James were called from the sea. 
They came back to where they started.

Everyone hated tax collectors, because they would steal the money from the people and give it to the Romans.

Levi was the tax collector when John and James would have been at the fishing company and he would have been their tax collector their whole life.

 Think about how John and James would have felt, they would have hated Levi and didn’t see the potential and how he could become Matthew.
 Sometimes we can only see a Levi because of what they have done to us or who they are but Jesus sees a Matthew who can change the world and write a book of the Bible.
 Levi had success, money and a future but lays it all down and dies to his old self and becomes Matthew who is the opposite.

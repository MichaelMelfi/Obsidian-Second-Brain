## All In
> ““The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and covered up. Then in his ==joy== he goes and sells ==all== that he has and buys that field.
‭‭==Matthew‬ ‭13‬:‭44‬ ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/mat.13.44-46.ESV

When you find out the value of the kingdom.
You will happily give everything up for it as nothing else compares.

> In poker, when you know you have the best cards, you push all your money and everything you have into the table and say “all in” because you know there is no way of you loosing.

> ““Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls, who, on finding one pearl of great value, went and sold ==all== that he had and bought it.”
‭‭==Matthew‬ ‭13‬:‭45‬-‭46‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/mat.13.45-46.ESV

What is your pearl of great price?
Your pear if great price will determine your life and future.


> What you count as most valuable will determine your destiny… because destiny is not a mystery it is a decision.

Tests are good
If you had a heart attack and someone said that they are a doctor so can help you however they didn’t pass their medical test, would you let them operate on your heart?

Pass the test.
Abraham and Isaac.

## 
A heart study
> “Trust in the Lord, and do good; dwell in the land and befriend faithfulness. 
> Delight yourself in the Lord, and he will give you the desires of your heart.”
‭‭==Psalm‬ ‭37‬:‭3‬-‭4‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/psa.37.4.ESV

It says take delight in the lord
Trust in the lord
And when you do those, He changes your heart.

> “The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately sick; who can understand it? 
> “I the Lord search the heart and test the mind, to give every man according to his ways, according to the fruit of his deeds.””
‭‭==Jeremiah‬ ‭17‬:‭9‬-‭10‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/jer.17.9-10.ESV

This says your heart lies to you

> “I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you shall be clean from all your uncleannesses, and from all your idols I will cleanse you. 
> And I will give you a new heart, and a new spirit I will put within you. And I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh.”
‭‭==Ezekiel‬ ‭36‬:‭25‬-‭26‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/ezk.36.25-26.ESV

He says he will put another heart inside of you and take the old.

1. Your heart starts at Jeremiah 17, deceitful.

2. Then goes to Ezekiel 36 and you get a new heart.

3. Then only then when you have the desires of God will you have Psalms 37.


## Joy Of The Cost
In acts it says that the disciples got whipped for preaching the gospel but they came back REJOICING????

> “But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law.”
‭‭==Galatians‬ ‭5‬:‭22‬-‭23‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/gal.5.22-23.ESV
You have a joy as a Christian that no one else in the world can have.

> “Count it all joy, my brothers, when you meet trials of various kinds, for you know that the testing of your faith produces steadfastness. And let steadfastness have its full effect, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing.”
‭‭==James‬ ‭1‬:‭2‬-‭4‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/jas.1.2-4.ESV
[[YouTube - David Guzik - James 1 - Faith And Endurance - Hard Times And Wisdom]]
When you go through trials, BE JOYFUL.

> “looking to Jesus, the founder and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God.”
‭‭==Hebrews‬ ‭12‬:‭2‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/heb.12.2.ESV

Even though, Jesus was being killed He still had JOY.
Because He knew what was before Him and He knew what it was for.
The joy he saw was US, he was thinking about US.

> “Though you have not seen him, you love him. Though you do not now see him, you believe in him and rejoice with joy that is inexpressible and filled with glory, obtaining the outcome of your faith, the salvation of your souls.”
==‭‭1 Peter‬ ‭1‬:‭8‬-‭9‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/1pe.1.8-9.ESV

### How do we have Joy?
> “But now I am coming to you, and these things I speak in the world, that they may have my joy fulfilled in themselves.”
‭‭==John‬ ‭17‬:‭13‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/jhn.17.13.ESV
> “As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you. Abide in my love. If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love, just as I have kept my Father’s commandments and abide in his love.”
‭‭==John‬ ‭15‬:‭9‬-‭10‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/jhn.15.9-10.ESV

You must obey His commands.

## The rich man, what not to do.
Mark 10:17-31

> “And as he was setting out on his journey, a man ran up and knelt before him and asked him, “Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?” And Jesus said to him, “Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone. You know the commandments: ‘Do not murder, Do not commit adultery, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Do not defraud, Honor your father and mother.’” And he said to him, “Teacher, all these I have kept from my youth.””
‭‭==Mark‬ ‭10‬:‭17‬-‭20‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/mrk.10.17-20.ESV

A man wants to follow Jesus
The man thinks he has everything done.
He is rich, smart, religious, confident.

> “And Jesus, looking at him, loved him, and said to him, “You lack one thing: go, sell all that you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.””
‭‭==Mark‬ ‭10‬:‭21‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/mrk.10.21.ESV

Jesus said that on the man’s throne is money.
The man then chooses to not take it off the throne

> “Disheartened by the saying, he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions.”
‭‭==Mark‬ ‭10‬:‭22‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/mrk.10.22.ESV

Jesus invited him to go ALL IN but chose to keep Jesus off the throne.

The bro then went away, the rich boy ruler would have became a rich man ruler
His life would have carried on but it would have gone the opposite way to the disciples.

## ALL IN
==Judges 6 (Gideon)==
==Exodus 3 (Moses)==
==Joshua 1 (Joshua)==
All these men made excuses but God said to all of them “I AM WITH YOU”
Lord = Yahweh
Lord = YHWY 
In old Jewish times, Instead of saying YHWH they would just pause and be quiet because God is so big that they wouldn’t even say His name.
So when they hear YHWH is with you, they knew nothing would go wrong because He is so much bigger than anything they will come up against.

==Matthew 28 (the great commission)==
He says AM I WILL BE WITH YOU.
The disciples that He was talking too knew the stories of the three examples above, they are all Jewish men, so when he says I AM WITH YOU.
They hear YHWH is with you and they understood.
Just like the examples above, if God is with you then nothing can be against you.

# YWAM - 6th Week - NATURE AND CHARACTER OF GOD (FATHER HEART OF GOD) 2-1 - Jonathan Vergauwen - Who Is God?


# Who Is God?:
## Rejoicing Every Day:
> “This is the day the Lord has made. We will rejoice and be glad in it.”
‭‭==Psalms‬ ‭118‬:‭24‬ ‭NLT‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/116/psa.118.24.NLT

Let us ‘REJOICE’ - Rejoicing means re applying your joy. [[Pasted image 20250211100505.png]]
Every day is good because every day God has made and everything God makes is good!


The thief comes to steal kill and destroy but God said he has come to give life in all its goodness

> “The thief does not come except to steal, and to kill, and to destroy. I have come that they may have life, and that they may have it more abundantly.”
‭‭==John‬ ‭10‬:‭10‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/jhn.10.10.NKJV

## What Is God?:

### Character vs Nature:
While "character" refers to the developed traits and qualities of a person, shaped by their experiences and choices, "nature" signifies their innate and inherent qualities, essentially the foundation of their being, which are considered largely unchangeable; in simple terms, ==character is what you become, while nature is what you are born with==.

In the context of God, ==nature refers to God's fundamental makeup, while character refers to the combination of God's attributes==

Nature: https://www.ffministry.com/blog/what-is-the-nature-of-god#:~:text=At%20its%20core%2C%20the%20Christian,power%2C%20knowledge%2C%20and%20presence.
- God Is All Powerful - omnipotent
- God Is All Knowing - omniscient
- God Is Everywhere (Always Present) - omnipresent

Character: https://www.biblestudytools.com/bible-study/topical-studies/15-amazing-attributes-of-god-what-they-mean-and-why-they-matter.html
- God Is Kind
- God Is Love
- God Is Faithful
- God is Merciful

### GOD IS LOVE

> “Thus says the Lord: “Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, 
Let not the mighty man glory in his might,
Nor let the rich man glory in his riches; 
But let him who glories glory in this, 
That he understands and knows Me, 
That I am the Lord, exercising lovingkindness, judgment, and righteousness in the earth. 
For in these I delight,” says the Lord. 
“Behold, the days are coming,” says the Lord, “that I will punish all who are circumcised with the uncircumcised— Egypt, Judah, Edom, the people of Ammon, Moab, and all who are in the farthest corners, who dwell in the wilderness. For all these nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in the heart.””
‭‭==Jeremiah‬ ‭9‬:‭23‬-‭26‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/jer.9.23-26.NKJV

The Knowing in the original text refers to a relational knowing, not a knowledge knowing.
It is talking about revelation knowledge.


> “And this is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom You have sent.”
==‭‭John‬ ‭17‬:‭3‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/jhn.17.3.NKJV

Eternity just means knowing God!
So as soon as you become a believer that is why you inherit eternity.
#### Glass Analogy:
God is constant and perfect all the time.
When we speak about Adam and Eve being image bearers this means that they bear the image of all three Father, Son, Holy Spirit.
It’s like a pane of glass and a light shining through it.
One is dirty and doesn’t let all the light through.
The second is clean, it might still have scratches and marks but it not dirty with sin so can let all the light through it.
So it doesn’t just help us but people should be able to see all of the light of God shining through us no matter what day it is, no matter the situation.

#### Callings:

> “As the deer pants for the water brooks, 
So pants my soul for You, O God.
My soul thirsts for God, for the living God.
When shall I come and appear before God?”
‭‭==Psalms‬ ‭42‬:‭1‬-‭2‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/psa.42.1-2.NKJV

Highest Calling:
- This is David writing this, it was his highest calling.
- Yes David made a lot of mistakes but his highest calling and desire was to be as close with God as he can.
- This is everyone’s highest calling on the earth.
- We are all called to know God and get closer to him.

General Calling:
- Our general calling is to make God know and make disciples of all nations.

Personal Calling:
- Some of us are too focused on our personal calling which is asking God what we need to do, where we need to go.

### GOD IS MERCIFUL

We cannot make God known if we don’t know God full ourselves.

What is knowledge if we do not act on it!
God is all powerful so He can do what he wants on earth but He wants to use us for bringing the gospel!
There are so so many people who haven’t heard the gospel yet and we are the ones to do that.
GOD WANTS PEOPLE SAVED, but it has to be their decision otherwise it is not love.

### GOD IS GOOD AND FAITHFUL

> “But what things were gain to me, these I have counted loss for Christ. Yet indeed I also count all things loss for the excellence of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them as rubbish, that I may gain Christ”
‭‭==Philippians‬ ‭3‬:‭7‬-‭8‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/php.3.7-8.NKJV

Everything that Paul used to love he now sees as rubbish as he knows there is the higher purpose.

The word rubbish in the original text is actually a lot worse than rubbish, it actually is talking about when you go to the toilet, so poo or shit.

The song (Goodness Of God):
All my life you have been faithful. All my life you have been so so good
Your goodness is running after its running after me.

Now, find a verse, chapter where is says God is good or a story where Gods goodness is shown.

Knowing God is good is not about a feeling:
(Yesterday I felt so good so God must be good!)
(I had such a good sleep, thank you, God is good!)
(Oh but yesterday was a bad day so does that mean God is bad?)
(You have a bad sleep so does that mean God is now bad?)

> “This is the day the Lord has made; We will rejoice and be glad in it.”
==‭‭Psalms‬ ‭118‬:‭24‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/psa.118.24.NKJV

This goes back to Psalm 118:
This is the day the lord has made so Every day is good no matter how you feel, your circumstance or situations!


God does not say life will be easy, nowhere in the bible does it say this!
But He promises that He will be with us through it all.


### GOD IS TRUTH

Truth = That which is true or in accordance with fact or reality.

 **Why did Jesus come to the earth?**
To bear witness/bring witness to the truth!

> “Jesus told him, “I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one can come to the Father except through me.”
‭‭==John‬ ‭14‬:‭6‬ ‭NLT‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/116/jhn.14.6.NLT

> “Jesus answered, “My kingdom is not of this world. If My kingdom were of this world, My servants would fight, so that I should not be delivered to the Jews; but now My kingdom is not from here.” Pilate therefore said to Him, “Are You a king then?” Jesus answered, “You say rightly that I am a king. For this cause I was born, and for this cause I have come into the world, that I should bear witness to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth hears My voice.” Pilate said to Him, “What is truth?” And when he had said this, he went out again to the Jews, and said to them, “I find no fault in Him at all.”
‭‭==John‬ ‭18‬:‭36‬-‭38‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/jhn.18.36-38.NKJV

We start to believe lies about God and one of those is you are your own authority.
You start to decide what it true and what is not true but this is a lie and a diseption.

If a teacher draws a wonky line on the board and says it is straight, it does not make it true.
No matter what the teacher says, it will not make the wonky line straight.

What is your picture of God?
The truth is that God is perfect, is your picture of God perfect or has it been distorted by personal experiences or by what other people have said?
By having a distorted line this could impact how you pray, how your praise and worship, how you teach, how to talk with people.

This can also then affect how we see ourselves.
If we do not have the right picture of ourselves, then this will lead to the wrong image of God.

For example, if you see yourself as ugly and not handsome or beautiful then that will fall into blaming God for making you ugly.
God makes everything perfect and He made you in His image so that is a distorted truth!

### The Standard
If you make a ruler, it is done in a specific factory a precisely and all of them are the same.

[[Note 12 Feb 2025.pdf]]
What is wrong with this ruler?
Nothing is equal, if you measured with this ruler then you would get the measurements wrong.
It’s because I made the ruler ourselves.

This is like us trying to make our own image of God based on our own estimations, own experiences.

We must get our Image of God from the Bible and the bible only otherwise it will be distorted and we will get the wrong things from it!

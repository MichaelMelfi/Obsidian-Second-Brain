The Love of God
How fathers and mums can influence the way you see the Heavenly Father

# YWAM - 6th Week -  NATURE AND CHARACTER OF GOD (FATHER HEART OF GOD) 4-1 - Jonathan Vergauwen - Gods Love (Father Love)

## Gods love:

Some of us don't truly think that God loves us that why we long after feeling Gods love and feeling his presence.
If you know God loves you, it doesn’t matter about a feeling because no matter what is happening and no matter the circumstance, you know that God loves you.

Just like a marriage, you will know that your partner loves you even if they didn’t bring you any presents.
But if you are not sure if they love you, you will be waiting and dependant on them doing things for you.

It’s like if you have kids, if you are in a different country to them and cannot see them you still know they love you and you love them even if there is 10000 miles between you.

This is why it is so dangerous to base everything off of your feelings because your feelings can change.
Take the word of God as your stand point because that will never change.
There is no on and off switch for the love of God.
God does not turn it on and turn it off when He wants.
Some people think that if they don’t read the bible, God will not love us.
If we don’t pray today, he wont love us.
No this is not true.
While it is important to read your bible and pray every day, but not because we want to earn his love.
We read and pray because we are in a relationship with Him and know Him better, and be able to recognise His voice.
No matter what we do, He won’t love us more or less.

His love is unconditional and eternal. You cannot have eternal love that is conditional because if God stopped His love because of something, it would not be eternal.

#### How much does God love us?
> ““I am praying not only for these disciples but also for all who will ever believe in me through their message. I pray that they will all be one, just as you and I are one—as you are in me, Father, and I am in you. And may they be in us so that the world will believe you sent me. “I have given them the glory you gave me, so they may be one as we are one. I am in them and you are in me. May they experience such perfect unity that the world will know that you sent me and that you love them as much as you love me.”
‭‭==John‬ ‭17‬:‭20‬-‭23‬ ‭NLT‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/116/jhn.17.20-23.NLT

God loves us as much as He loves JESUS
How can that be when Jesus was PERFECT, He did not Sin
Jesus is also part of God.

Because His love is unconditional
> “There is no greater love than to lay down one’s life for one’s friends.”
‭‭==John‬ ‭15‬:‭13‬ ‭NLT‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/116/jhn.15.13.NLT

Jesus showed His love on the cross.

> “But to all who believed him and accepted him, he gave the right to become children of God.”
‭‭==John‬ ‭1‬:‭12‬ ‭NLT‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/116/jhn.1.12.NLT

He is a LOVING FATHER
We are HIS CHILDREN

#### Examples in the bible of Jesus loving:
- The children wanted to come to Jesus but his disciples turned them away because they didn’t think they were important but Jesus said “let the little children come to me”
- The lady of the blood, The woman grabbed Jesus’ garment and she took her healing, the disciples were telling him to keep going but He stopped and said who touched me and spoke with her.

### Types of fathers or mothers and how it might effect our view of God
#### Good Father
- These fathers are great, you grow up with values etc but it can maybe be hard to find a partner to marry because you compare everyone to your dad.
- You might think you don't need a Heavenly Father because you have a good earthly father

#### Performance-Oriented Father
- They only care about results
- Everything comes from a results standing
- You might grow up thinking you are not good enough because you did not perform well.
- This can leak into how you read the bible or think of God because you will think you have to be perfect to become His child
- You will start to judge people not on how they are but based on what they do for you and around you.
- This can then mean it will not feel like love with God because you have to keep on proving yourself.

#### Passive Father
- This father, is always around near you but never does anything with you or for you.
- This father doesn’t show that he loves you, he maybe doesn’t know how to show it or demonstrate love to you.
- These dads are something dads who work very hard and then when they come home and are tired they can’t or don‘t spend time with the kids.
- These dads are usually pastors or missionaries because they are always there for other people and not their kids.
- This relationship will feel distant meaning this will leak into our bible relationship with God because it will feel different.
- You might think that God is too busy to be with you or care about you because there is more important things going on.

#### Absent Father
- a Father who is just not there, for many different reasons
- This could be death, sickness, not caring, divorce, distance (working somewhere else)
- You might feel like an orphan even if you aren’t
- The family or home doesn’t feel safe because the father is meant to create that safe place for you but isn’t there to do that.
- If you don‘t have a safe place at home, you will go around your life trying to find another safe place, drugs, other people (relationships), gangs etc.
- This can cause you to not be able to trust God because you will think He will leave you aswell.
- You might be afraid to open up so will because very independent. (I don‘t need anyone in my life)
- There might be a deep anger towards God

#### Authoritarian Father
- This father demands obedience no matter what. What he says is the law
- He will use the same rules for every child, no uniqueness
- There will be no good bonding because they wont understand each child independently.
- The child will feel fear and intimidation
- You might then feel like God is to be feared instead of enjoyed or loved.
- You relationship with God will not feel like a safe place.
- You will think that God is always there to catch you out or get you.
- That He is always pointing his finger to you.
- You will then have a very high standard for other Christians as you will demand the laws etc of the bible from everyone.
- You will feel more like a servant of God than a Child Of God.

#### Abusive Father
- A father who deliberately causes pain to his children
- Mentally abusive, physically abusive, emotionally abusive, sexually abusive
- This can be because of Injust punishment
- There will be a deep sense of shame and or not feeling clean, or guilt
- The child has no trust in authority or other people.
- A deep sense of a fear for men or woman (whoever did the abuse)
- They will think its their fault that they got abused
- This will create a very strong anger towards the person or God or just people in general.
- This can lead to you doing the same to other people later in your life
- It will be very very hard to see God a loving Father


### Types Of Things Every Human Needs

#### Unconditional Expressed Love
- Not just love that we know is there but an expressed love that is shown to us or given to us.
- Otherwise the child or person will feel rejected.
##### The 5 acts of love
- Words of affirmation
- Physical Touch
- Gifts
- Acts Of Service
- Quality Time

#### The Need For Praise And Affirmation
- A child needs to be praised and affirmed.
- When we don‘t get praise and affirmation from parents then we will find our praise and affirmation somewhere else or in someone else (These are known as life painkillers)

#### Security And Comfort
- You will get hurt in life, that is a given.
- You cannot protect yourselves from all hurt
- Comfort will bring healing but when there is no healing then all the pains will go into something called your pain tank. Which is somewhere that hides all your previous pains.
- You’ve got to open your pain tank and all God into this to bring restoration

#### Need For A Purpose In life
- You need to know you have a future and a purpose.
- Why am i here?
- If you have the 3 above from your parents then you will see that there is a purpose but if you do not get the above from your parents then you most likely will not know your purpose.

**A true relationship must have the giving and receiving of love**

### Missions/Outreaches in the bible:

> “It was by faith that Abraham obeyed when God called him to leave home and go to another land that God would give him as his inheritance. He went without knowing where he was going. And even when he reached the land God promised him, he lived there by faith—for he was like a foreigner, living in tents. And so did Isaac and Jacob, who inherited the same promise. Abraham was confidently looking forward to a city with eternal foundations, a city designed and built by God.”
‭‭==Hebrews‬ ‭11‬:‭8‬-‭10‬ ‭NLT‬‬==

> “It was by faith that Moses’ parents hid him for three months when he was born. They saw that God had given them an unusual child, and they were not afraid to disobey the king’s command. It was by faith that Moses, when he grew up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter. He chose to share the oppression of God’s people instead of enjoying the fleeting pleasures of sin. He thought it was better to suffer for the sake of Christ than to own the treasures of Egypt, for he was looking ahead to his great reward. It was by faith that Moses left the land of Egypt, not fearing the king’s anger. He kept right on going because he kept his eyes on the one who is invisible. It was by faith that Moses commanded the people of Israel to keep the Passover and to sprinkle blood on the doorposts so that the angel of death would not kill their firstborn sons.”
‭‭==Hebrews‬ ‭11‬:‭23‬-‭28‬ ‭NLT‬‬==

### Read: Genesis 1-2:2
> “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. The earth was without form, and void; and darkness was on the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters. Then God said, “Let there be light”; and there was light. And God saw the light, that it was good; and God divided the light from the darkness. God called the light Day, and the darkness He called Night. So the evening and the morning were the first day. Then God said, “Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.” Thus God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament; and it was so. And God called the firmament Heaven. So the evening and the morning were the second day. Then God said, “Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear”; and it was so. And God called the dry land Earth, and the gathering together of the waters He called Seas. And God saw that it was good. Then God said, “Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb that yields seed, and the fruit tree that yields fruit according to its kind, whose seed is in itself, on the earth”; and it was so. And the earth brought forth grass, the herb that yields seed according to its kind, and the tree that yields fruit, whose seed is in itself according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. So the evening and the morning were the third day. Then God said, “Let there be lights in the firmament of the heavens to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs and seasons, and for days and years; and let them be for lights in the firmament of the heavens to give light on the earth”; and it was so. Then God made two great lights: the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night. He made the stars also. God set them in the firmament of the heavens to give light on the earth, and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good. So the evening and the morning were the fourth day. Then God said, “Let the waters abound with an abundance of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the face of the firmament of the heavens.” So God created great sea creatures and every living thing that moves, with which the waters abounded, according to their kind, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. And God blessed them, saying, “Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.” So the evening and the morning were the fifth day. Then God said, “Let the earth bring forth the living creature according to its kind: cattle and creeping thing and beast of the earth, each according to its kind”; and it was so. And God made the beast of the earth according to its kind, cattle according to its kind, and everything that creeps on the earth according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. Then God said, “Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, and over the cattle, over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.” So God created man in His own image; in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them. Then God blessed them, and God said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply; fill the earth and subdue it; have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, and over every living thing that moves on the earth.” And God said, “See, I have given you every herb that yields seed which is on the face of all the earth, and every tree whose fruit yields seed; to you it shall be for food. Also, to every beast of the earth, to every bird of the air, and to everything that creeps on the earth, in which there is life, I have given every green herb for food”; and it was so. Then God saw everything that He had made, and indeed it was very good. So the evening and the morning were the sixth day.”
‭‭Genesis‬ ‭1‬:‭1‬-‭31‬ ‭NKJV‬‬
https://bible.com/bible/114/gen.1.1-31.NKJV
> “Thus the heavens and the earth, and all the host of them, were finished. And on the seventh day God ended His work which He had done, and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had done. Then God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, because in it He rested from all His work which God had created and made. This is the history of the heavens and the earth when they were created, in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens,”
‭‭Genesis‬ ‭2‬:‭1‬-‭4‬ ‭NKJV‬‬
https://bible.com/bible/114/gen.2.1-4.NKJV

### Why did God create the whole universe if we only use one planet and one solar system? 
> “For ever since the world was created, people have seen the earth and sky. Through everything God made, they can clearly see his invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature. So they have no excuse for not knowing God.”
‭‭==Romans‬ ‭1‬:‭20‬ ‭NLT‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/116/rom.1.20.NLT

So that we would not have an excuse to there being a God, that it would be obvious that the universe is too big for us or a natural occurrence.

### Is Anything Too Hard For Our God?

> “Then one of them said, “I will return to you about this time next year, and your wife, Sarah, will have a son!” Sarah was listening to this conversation from the tent. Abraham and Sarah were both very old by this time, and Sarah was long past the age of having children. So she laughed silently to herself and said, “How could a worn-out woman like me enjoy such pleasure, especially when my master—my husband—is also so old?” Then the Lord said to Abraham, “Why did Sarah laugh? Why did she say, ‘Can an old woman like me have a baby?’ Is anything too hard for the Lord? I will return about this time next year, and Sarah will have a son.””
‭‭==Genesis‬ ‭18‬:‭10‬-‭14‬ ‭NLT‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/116/gen.18.10-14.NLT

“Is anything too hard for the lord?”!
Nothing is too hard for the lord!

It might be to show that God can handle anything and everything in our lives if he would the one to create the universe
We might be worried and doubt that God can’t sort out our situation, or family situation or worldly situation
YES HE CAN
He has made the whole universe, he can easily do what you need.

“Is anything too hard for the lord?”

What miracle are you grabbing hold of today?
 Do not wait, if you wait you might miss your chance.

Woman of the blood - she didn’t care what everyone thought, she pushed through the crowed and grabbed her healing

Zakious in the tree - He climbed a tree to make sure he could see and hear Jesus talk

The blind begger - He heard Jesus was walking past, he shouted and everyone told him to be quiet, he then shouted again and made Jesus hear him even though everyone else was telling him to shush.

### Read: Genesis 2:8-9 and Genesis 2:16-17

> “The Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden, and there He put the man whom He had formed. And out of the ground the Lord God made every tree grow that is pleasant to the sight and good for food. The tree of life was also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.”
‭‭==Genesis‬ ‭2‬:‭8‬-‭9‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/gen.2.8-9.NKJV

> “And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, “Of every tree of the garden you may freely eat; but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die.””
‭‭==Genesis‬ ‭2‬:‭16‬-‭17‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/gen.2.16-17.NKJV

Love is not love unless it is freely chosen.
This tree is to do with free will.
God put it there so they had the choice to love God or not.
If everything was perfect without any test then it wouldn’t have been true love because there wouldn’t have been the free will to chose to love God.

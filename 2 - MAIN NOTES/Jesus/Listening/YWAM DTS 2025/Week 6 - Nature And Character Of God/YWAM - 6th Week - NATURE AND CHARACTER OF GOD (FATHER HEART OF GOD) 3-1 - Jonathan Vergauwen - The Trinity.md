The word Trinity is not in the bible at all.
**Trinity literally means - three in one**
We will not fully understand it, we cannot fully understand it.
We can learn as much as we can but we will not fully know everything.
Because we cannot fully understand it we try and use metaphors/stories to explain the Trinity.
#### Metaphors For The Trinity
- H20
Water, Steam, Ice. All are the same thing but in different states

- Egg
Egg white, Yoke, Shell. All make the egg but are different parts

- Human
Mind, Body, Spirit. All make up a person but they are distinct parts.

- Coffee
Coffee, Milk, Sugar. All make the coffee

- Matches
Light three matches you will have three individual fires, now put them together and there will be one big flame.
#### HISTORY:

A lot of places around Israel were worshiping many Gods (polytheism)
Then there are the Jews who believe in YHWH

> ““Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one!”
‭‭==Deuteronomy‬ ‭6‬:‭4‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/deu.6.4.NKJV

LORD:
Lord in the Old Testament refers to YHWH.
YHWH our God, YHWH is one.

ONE:
There are two different types of ONE in Hebrew
- One refers to, one singular thing
- The other refers to, Ahat which means one in harmony or one in mind
Ahat is used with Adam and Eve where they were one in harmony.

GOD:
Elohim = God’S

It’s not obvious to us but in Hebrew it is obvious that God is three in one.

#### God talking to the trinity
##### Old Testament:
- **Let US make mankind into OUR image**
> “Then God said, “Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, and over the cattle, over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.””
‭‭==Genesis‬ ‭1‬:‭26‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/gen.1.26.NKJV

- **The Tower of Babel**
Let US go down and see what mankind is doing

- **Isaiah called to be a prophet**
> “Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying: “Whom shall I send, And who will go for Us?” Then I said, “Here am I! Send me.””
‭‭==Isaiah‬ ‭6‬:‭8‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/isa.6.8.NKJV

##### New Testament:
**Baptism Of Jesus**
> “When He had been baptized, Jesus came up immediately from the water; and behold, the heavens were opened to Him, and He saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting upon Him.”
‭‭==Matthew‬ ‭3‬:‭16‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/mat.3.16.NKJV


During the time of the 400 years of silence from Malachi to Matthew they were waiting for the Messiah to come.

So then Jesus was born and made his ministry
The Jews rejected Him because they expected a worrier to save them.
They expected something different
They said “What kind of man is this, He stills the storm”

Even the demons that Jesus was rebuking knew who he was “I know who you are, you are the son of God”


> “He said to them, “But who do you say that I am?” 
Simon Peter answered and said, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.””
‭‭==Matthew‬ ‭16‬:‭15‬-‭16‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/mat.16.15-16.NKJV

Jesus was 2 years into his ministry and was waiting to hear someone say this!

#### God Is Love

> “And now, O Father, glorify Me together with Yourself, with the glory which I had with You before the world was.”
‭‭==John‬ ‭17‬:‭5‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/jhn.17.5.NKJV

> ““Father, I desire that they also whom You gave Me may be with Me where I am, that they may behold My glory which You have given Me; for You loved Me before the foundation of the world.”
‭‭==John‬ ‭17‬:‭24‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/jhn.17.24.NKJV

God did not create love
If God is eternal and has always been here
God is love meaning there has always been love
There is not a first time God loved.
It is the most perfect relationship there has ever been!
If you say it is not complete love then you are saying there is something wrong with God.

#### Why Did God NOT Create Us
- **Because He Was Lonely**
This Can’t be true because then the trinity is not satisfied and something is missing meaning He is not perfect.

- **Because He Was Bored**
This would imply that God does not know what to do or say anymore and ran out of ideas.
This would mean God is imperfect.
Being bored is a human thing.

- **Because He Needs Something From Us**
This cannot be true God does not need anything and if He did then he would not be perfect and not be all powerful.
He has everything already!
He is in complete perfect harmony.

- **Because He Wants To Establish/Build His Kingdom**
He is the lord of lord and king of kings, what is the point of ruling if there is no one to rule over?
It’s like having a kingdom and having no one in the kingdom, there is no point in the kingdom.
But this cannot be true 

- **Because He Wants Our Worship**
The Angels worship him 24/7, He didn’t need any more!
He loves our worship but he didn’t make us to specifically worship.

- **Because He Wants Us To Serve Him**
God is not lazy, He is not too busy, He doesn’t need help!
Serving is to test our obedience, hear his voice, flexibility, willingness, walk with him.

So if things cannot get any better, what is the point in making us?


#### Why’s Did God Create US?

BECAUSE HE WANTS TO EXPAND WHAT IS ALREADY THERE.
God wants more love around and to have others enjoy what He Has.
When there is love, love gives and doesn’t take.

If I have chocolate I like to give it to others so they can also share in the enjoyment of what I already have.

He created us to share and step into the relationship with Him

When you are in relationship, you do not lack anything. You have everything to be in the relationship.
We are made in the image and likeness of God
So we have everything we need.

He gave us
- Mind
- Will
- Emotions

> Can you be in a relationship without free will?
 Love is not love unless it is freely chosen.

God only wants genuine love otherwise he is a dictator.
That’s why you must choose Him.

#### Story of the watermelon:
God expects us to be a perfect watermelon.
Same on the outside then on the inside.

You are in a group of friends
You get a watermelon from the shop and it looks perfect from the outside.
But you take it home, cut it open and its mouldy on the inside.

Some of us are like the watermelon that we say we love God but on the inside we are mouldy and rotten and full of flesh desires and sin.
God wants us to be a prefect watermelon.
Genuine love inside and out.

He is actually more interested about the inside than the outside because it is the inside of the watermelon that you eat, it doesn’t matter what the outside looks like as long as the inside is completely perfect and ripe.

#### What Have I Learnt From This Teaching?:

- God is always the same
He isn’t an angry God in the Old Testament and a nice God in the New Testament.
He always wants fellowship and relationship, it was out of Mercy he didn’t start the world again and out of mercy that he chose a group of people.
- He wants relationship and fellowship!


# YWAM - 6th Week -  NATURE AND CHARACTER OF GOD (FATHER HEART OF GOD) 1-1 - Jonathan Vergauwen

Pray this out to someone word for word and replace the word us and you with the persons name.

> “When I think of all this, I fall to my knees and pray to the Father, the Creator of everything in heaven and on earth. I pray that from his glorious, unlimited resources he will empower you with inner strength through his Spirit. Then Christ will make his home in your hearts as you trust in him. Your roots will grow down into God’s love and keep you strong. And may you have the power to understand, as all God’s people should, how wide, how long, how high, and how deep his love is. May you experience the love of Christ, though it is too great to understand fully. Then you will be made complete with all the fullness of life and power that comes from God. Now all glory to God, who is able, through his mighty power at work within us, to accomplish infinitely more than we might ask or think. Glory to him in the church and in Christ Jesus through all generations forever and ever! Amen.”
‭‭==Ephesians‬ ‭3‬:‭14‬-‭21‬ ‭NLT‬‬==

### Knowledge vs Information:
Old YWAM slogan:
“It’s not about heads full of knowledge, but it’s about hearts full of faith and reaching out to others.
Its not about information, its about revelation”

For example, I could tell you everything about my dad, how amazing he is, how great a leader he is, how great a dad he is.
But Until you meet him personally you will not fully know and understand what I’ve told you because you do not know him.
But once you’ve worked with him and hung around with him you will understand and be able to agree with me.
That is the difference between revelation and information.



### Story Of The Whole Bible: [[IMG_5823.jpg]]
#### Everything starts with God (Eternity Past)
- God (Father, Son, Holy Spirit) Is there for Eternity past and future
- He is the one who was, who is and is to come
> ““I am the Alpha and the Omega—the beginning and the end,” says the Lord God. “I am the one who is, who always was, and who is still to come—the Almighty One.””
‭‭==Revelation‬ ‭1‬:‭8‬ ‭NLT‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/116/rev.1.8.NLT
- The son is not Jesus, he only became Jesus when he was born on earth,   It is His earth name

#### Creation Story
- God created everything perfect.
- God said, “let us make human image bearers”
> “Then God said, “Let us make human beings in our image, to be like us. They will reign over the fish in the sea, the birds in the sky, the livestock, all the wild animals on the earth, and the small animals that scurry along the ground.” So God created human beings in his own image. In the image of God he created them; male and female he created them.”
‭‭==Genesis‬ ‭1‬:‭26‬-‭27‬ ‭NLT‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/116/gen.1.26-27.NLT
We are the image of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.
We are also meant to reflect the image of God as well not just look it.
Everything was perfect, no sin, no shame, no wars.
- God trusts man, He says take dominion with me and be fruitful and multiply.

#### The Fall
==Genesis 3==
- Man breaks Gods trust and hands authority over to Satan (The Fall)
- They then became broken image bearers.
- Everything Goes wrong and now there is shame, sin, wars but most importantly they are now separated and out of the cover of God.
- God is so good though, He did not say I will start again. He came to Adam and Eve and said “Where are you?” (==Genesis 3:9==). 
Why does God say this?
He is all knowing so surly He should know where they are!
He knew exactly where they were.
He asked the question because they were out of his protection and lost and out of relationship with God, It was not a question of where are they physically but a question of where are they in their heart.
- Everything becomes so perverted that demons are having sex with humans and wars are everywhere that God says He will start again, He chooses Noah and that story happens.

#### Children of Abraham
- He chooses a group of people for his own.
- He knows that they are still broken image bearers and not perfect but he chooses them to carry his presence.
- He makes covenants with these people (Israel)
- He is not an angry God in the Old Testament like everyone says, no he loved people so much that even in their broken and sinful state he still choses to actually save people.
- He gets them to make a tabernacle so He can be in their presence and also for them to be able to be in His presence, He is still wanting to be relational and be with us!

- Israel constantly broke the law and the covenants they made with God and were not good all of the time! They keep messing up.

#### In Between Period
- There are then loads of kings and prophets etc that try and uphold the kingdom of God
- From Malachi (Last book of the Old Testament) and Matthew (First book of the New Testament) is 400 years.
- There was 400 years of silence, We know what happened around Israel due to other historical writings but we don’t hear anything from the Bible for 400 years (God did not say anything).
- During this time, they were waiting for the messiah that they were promised.

#### Jesus
- The word became flesh
> “So the Word became human and made his home among us. He was full of unfailing love and faithfulness. And we have seen his glory, the glory of the Father’s one and only Son.”
‭‭==John‬ ‭1‬:‭14‬ ‭NLT‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/116/jhn.1.14.NLT
- He did not just die for you, HE LIVED FOR YOU for 33 years before he died! Do not just focus on his death but tell people how he lived!
- Jesus is praying for you constantly.

#### Holy Spirit & Church
- Day of Pentecost in the upper room. (==Acts==)
- The First church is established
#### Now!
- We are a part of history (==Michael==)
- We are part of the bible story

When Jesus flipped the tables in the temple.
He did not flip the tables because they were selling things, but it was because of where they were selling things and how!
The Jews and internationals/pilgrims would praise and worship in different areas.
The Jews would only sell things where the internationals/pilgrims came to praise and worship.
This is because they could make easy money from them and would cheat them and turned it into a market place.
This then stopped people actually praising and worshiping, instead of the main reason and thing being praise and worship.

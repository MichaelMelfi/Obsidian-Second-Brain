It takes 3 months to build a Habit

Before Jesus did anything he would spend time with the Father and pray.
He would pray and then do miracles in between.

He woke up early and started the day with **praying**. 
If it is so important for Jesus then it should be important to us.

> “Before daybreak the next morning, Jesus got up and went out to an isolated place to pray.”
‭‭==Mark‬ ‭1‬:‭35‬ ‭NLT‬‬==

> “Then I will hold my head high above my enemies who surround me. At his sanctuary I will offer sacrifices with shouts of joy, singing and praising the Lord with music.”

# YWAM - 3rd Week - ACTIVATION WEEK - How To Share The Gospel
Gospel in Greek comes from the word unjellyun which means good news.

  

JOHN 3:16 

“For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.”

  

Acts 10:38

“how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power, who went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with Him.”

‭‭

Matthew 28-19

“Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,”

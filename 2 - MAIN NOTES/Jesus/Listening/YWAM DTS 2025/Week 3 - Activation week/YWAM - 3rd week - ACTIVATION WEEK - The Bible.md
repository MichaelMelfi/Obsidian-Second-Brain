Why should we trust it?

Biblically why should we trust it?

“All Scripture is inspired by God and is useful to teach us what is true and to make us realize what is wrong in our lives. It corrects us when we are wrong and teaches us to do what is right.”

‭‭2 Timothy‬ ‭3‬:‭16‬ ‭NLT‬‬

  

- Everything in the bible is useful, this means every book and every verse is helpful and needed. Every word was purposely written.

  

- ‘But 40 people wrote the bible!’

- God wrote through them

  

- Every book in the bible has a people group that book is written for and to.

- FOR EXAMPLE: Moses wrote Genesis while they were wondering in the wilderness for the 40 years.
- He wrote it for the Israelites.

  

Worldly why should be trust it?

- There are no in consistencies in the bible.

- Even from years of translations, being written by 40 different people, written over 1500 years.

  

- Manuscript Reliability

- The bible is an abnormality for old writing.
- We have over 5000 manuscripts of the New Testament in Greek.(The Dead Sea scrolls)
- We have about 200 documents for Socrates but 5000 for just the New Testament!

  

- Historical accuracy

- The bible covers so much history that has been proven by historical sources and old manuscripts and archeology.
- Everything in the Bible can be proved by science.

  

- Fulfilment of Prophecies

- There are 300 prophecies about Jesus and every single of these actually happened and the probability of that happening is 0.1 to the power of 1000

  

- Eye Witness Testimonies

- Most of the people who wrote the bible died for what they believed.

  

- Timeless Authority

- The Bible is the best selling book of all time and continues to be important and relevant throughout all its years.
- The Roman Empire tried to kill all the Christians yet they couldn’t.

  

- Supernatural Authority

- Where ever the Bible goes there is change that follows which is revival.

reading one book at a time is the best but only if you’ve read the whole bible already.

  

Four steps to read the bible.

1. Pray before your read that God will speak to you through it
2. Read the book that god has given you.
3. Highlight the important things
4. How do I apply this to my life

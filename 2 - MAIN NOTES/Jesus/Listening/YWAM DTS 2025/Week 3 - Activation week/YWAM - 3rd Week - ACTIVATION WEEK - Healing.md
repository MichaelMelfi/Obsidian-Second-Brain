# YWAM - 3rd Week - ACTIVATION WEEK - Healing
Focus on what you are FOR not what you’re AGAINST.

It’s not about you.

MATTHEW 4-24

“Jesus traveled throughout the region of Galilee, teaching in the synagogues and announcing the Good News about the Kingdom. And he healed every kind of disease and illness.”

‭He Healed all that came to him!

  

If you ever don’t know what to do in the day read this verse.

Preach, teach and heal the sick.

  

==Matthew 5,6,7 is the sermon on the mount.==

==Matthew 8,9 is focused on how Jesus healed the sick and cast out demons.==

Then at the end of Matthew 9

“Jesus traveled through all the towns and villages of that area, teaching in the synagogues and announcing the Good News about the Kingdom. And he healed every kind of disease and illness.”

Every verse says that the people came to him and followed him till they were healed!

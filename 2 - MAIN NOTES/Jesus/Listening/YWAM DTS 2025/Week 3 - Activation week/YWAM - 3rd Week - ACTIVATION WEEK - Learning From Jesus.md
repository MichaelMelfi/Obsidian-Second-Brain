# YWAM - 3rd Week - ACTIVATION WEEK - Learning From Jesus
Learning from Jesus on how to teach.

  

This week is about activating and physically doing what Jesus did to teach.

  

“Then Jesus said to them, “Follow Me, and I will make you become fishers of men.” They immediately left their nets and followed Him.”

‭‭Mark‬ ‭1‬:‭17‬-‭18‬ ‭NKJV‬‬

  

Most of the time Jesus taught, he showed someone how to do something, they didn’t spend much time in the classroom.

  

You cannot just teach people things you have to SHOW THEM.

  

  

What did Jesus do?

  

He spoke about the kingdom everywhere he went.

  

He Healed sick people and the disciples healed people.

  

He cast out demons.

  

He had an intimate relationship with God.

  

  

Our greatest need as disciples of Jesus is to apply the knowledge we have.

  

  

Is your knowledge to the bible the same level as your obedience to the bible.

  

So many people are like a tadpole, they have a massive head of knowledge but no body and strength.

  

STORY:

A dad tells a son to go and clean his room

The son then goes to his room.

Comes down 10 mins later and said

Dad I memorised what you said you said ‘go clean your room’

The dad then says great but did you clean your room?

The son says no I just memorised it.

It’s not what the father told him to do and the thing the son was meant to do he didn’t action it.

The son then goes back to his room and comes back down.

The father says have you cleaned your room now?

The son says I’ve learnt what you said in Greek and Hebrew and linked it with other things you’ve said.

This is not what the father said to do. They learnt all about the word but didn’t action it and do what they were meant to do.

This is the same as us and the bible.

We spend so much time learning about what god says to do and linking it all together and praying but we do not actually practice it and get things done and are obedient.

  

  

Matthew 7:24-27

““Therefore whoever hears these sayings of Mine, and does them, I will liken him to a wise man who built his house on the rock: and the rain descended, the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house; and it did not fall, for it was founded on the rock. “But everyone who hears these sayings of Mine, and does not do them, will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand: and the rain descended, the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house; and it fell. And great was its fall.””

‭‭

James 1:22-25

“Therefore lay aside all filthiness and overflow of wickedness, and receive with meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls. But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves. For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man observing his natural face in a mirror; for he observes himself, goes away, and immediately forgets what kind of man he was. But he who looks into the perfect law of liberty and continues in it, and is not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work, this one will be blessed in what he does.”

  

Matthew 4:18-20 

“And Jesus, walking by the Sea of Galilee, saw two brothers, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen. Then He said to them, “Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men.” They immediately left their nets and followed Him.”

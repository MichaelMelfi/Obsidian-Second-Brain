# YWAM - 3rd Week - ACTIVATION WEEK - Recognising Gods Voice

**Relationships and Intimacy**


**How do we listen to His voice?**
1. Read The *Bible*
2. Worship
3. Prayer
4. Spending Time With God


**How many voices do we hear every day?**
1. Your Voice
2. Others Voices
4. Enemy’s Voice
    - Brings us revenge
    - Brings us anger
    - Brings us sin

5. God’s Voice
    - Brings us Joy
    - Brings us Peace
    - Brings us Life

Sheep know the voice of their Shepard
No matter who calls them they will always only respond to their Shepard’s voice.

This is how we should be, no matter who calls, no matter what distractions there are, we only respond to God

> “The gatekeeper opens the gate for him, and the sheep recognize his voice and come to him. He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. After he has gathered his own flock, he walks ahead of them, and they follow him because they know his voice.”
‭‭==John‬ ‭10‬:‭3‬-‭4‬ ‭NLT‬‬==

If we live away from God we wont know what God’s voice Sounds like.

(We Then As a Class Listened To Gods Voice and Spoke Words Of Encouragement Over Each other)

### Reading The Bible
God can speak to us through a bible verse.
The Bible is literally the Word Of God.
Before you read a verse, ask God what He wants to say and what He wants you to get out of this reading.
You may get a word for yourself or someone else.
### Worship and Prayer
Prayer and Worship is one of the most intimate places you can be with God.
It is not about the song being sung but it is about your posture to the worship.
Find one thing you are attached to and change your ways.
Prayer is the bridge between you and God.
When you Worship it is just you and God, 1 on 1, Speaking truth, speaking life and healing you.
It is not an option to worship but an instruction
### Quiet Time With God
This time is you being quiet!
You listen and don’t speak.
When you are quiet you allow God to speak 
### Vision
This is where God shows you what he wants.
You might need to ask other people what the vision means
A Vision gives you the world through Gods eyes
A Vision is God showing you what He sees
> “‘In the last days,’ God says, ‘I will pour out my Spirit upon all people. Your sons and daughters will prophesy. Your young men will see visions, and your old men will dream dreams.”
‭‭==Acts of the Apostles‬ ‭2‬:‭17‬ ‭NLT‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/116/act.2.17.NLT
### Dream
Dream and vision is different
Dream is where you sleep and see a vision
> “‘In the last days,’ God says, ‘I will pour out my Spirit upon all people. Your sons and daughters will prophesy. Your young men will see visions, and your old men will dream dreams.”
‭‭==Acts of the Apostles‬ ‭2‬:‭17‬ ‭NLT‬‬==

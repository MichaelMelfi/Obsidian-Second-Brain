# YWAM - 3rd Week - ACTIVATION WEEK - Creative Worship

When were humans first creative?
When they named the animals etc in Genesis.

> “So the Lord God formed from the ground all the wild animals and all the birds of the sky. He brought them to the man to see what he would call them, and the man chose a name for each one. He gave names to all the livestock, all the birds of the sky, and all the wild animals. But still there was no helper just right for him.”
‭‭==Genesis‬ ‭2‬:‭19‬-‭20‬ ‭NLT‬‬==

> “Well, my brothers and sisters, let’s summarize. When you meet together, one will sing, another will teach, another will tell some special revelation God has given, one will speak in tongues, and another will interpret what is said. But everything that is done must strengthen all of you.”
==‭‭1 Corinthians‬ ‭14‬:‭26‬ ‭NLT‬‬==

Everyone is different.
You must be creative yourself because everyone has their own ‘**Rhythm**’.
You cannot copy someone else because then it will not be genuine.

# YWAM - 4th Week - FREEDOM WEEK 2-4 - Brad Lachapelle - Strongholds

What does the enemy see in your life that he is trying to sow strongholds in your life?
Why is Satan so scared of this generation that he has sown depression, suicide, sin etc?
It’s because this generation is the one to destroy the works of the Devil.

#### Our original design vs what Satan tries to sow into your life:

##### If you have a stronghold coming in your life or something that Satan is trying to attack, know that God made you for the opposite of that.
##### I am scared of public speaking BUT God has made me as a public speaker.

Generations are changed when one person decides to live in Freedom
Family’s are changed when one person decides to live in Freedom

##### What is a spiritual Strong hold? 
##### How is a spiritual stronghold built?
(Scriptures)

Satans stronghold construction:
1. A First ==Thought==
2. Making a ==Decision== to do that thought
3. ==Acting== on the Decision
4. This Changes ==Values==
5. Change of ==Lifestyle==
6. ==Bondage== to that thing

Humility is not thinking less of yourself or beating yourself down.
It is agreeing and lifting God up above yourself.

We must surrender our stubbornness, no matter what you think you deserve and say Jesus I am going to choose humility and agree with what you say about me
You say I’m forgiven, I’m forgiven.
You say mercy, there is mercy
You say grace, there is grace.

The Injustice that happens to us is NOT OUR FAULT and WASN'T GODS PLAN.

But our reaction to that injustice is our responsibility.

#### Repentance:

#### How to destroy Strongholds:

1. The weapon of Truth:
==John 14:6== ”Jesus is the way the truth and the life”
==John 8:32== “The Truth will set you FREE” 

2. The weapon of Jesus Christ’s Authority:
Story of the policeman who tries to stop the car.
The policeman has the authority to stop the car but not the power.
Now if the policeman was in a tank he has the authority and also the power to stop the car.
We have authority and power over Satan.

 3. The weapon of repentance

4. The weapon of Forgivness

5. The Weapons of prayer and spoken declaration
The power of life and death is in the tongue

7. The weapon of a humble and obedient life

# YWAM - 4th Week - FREEDOM WEEK 1-3 - Brad Lachapelle - Preaching The Gospel
#### Every gospel message should have 4 points
1. Relationship (We were all created for a relationship with God)
2. Sin and Death (everyone has sinned and that separates us from God)
3. Jesus, Death and Resurrection
4. Turn and Follow Jesus
Add a Bible Verse E.G John 3:16, 2 Corinthians 5:21

I was heavily addicted to drugs, suicidle , lost, depressed with what i thought was no way out, I was in and out of hospital with fatal damage in my body that was irreversible.
I ended up having to leave the country for a month with my mum to get away from everything i was surrounded by at home.
From then I started reading the bible for myself and it says in the bible you have peace that passes all understanding and this is exactly what i got.
Joy, peace and all the fatal things the doctors said they would need to take out and remove were completely restored and perfectly healthy and you can have the exact same thing.

> “But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you. And you will be my witnesses, telling people about me everywhere—in Jerusalem, throughout Judea, in Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.””
‭‭==Acts of the Apostles‬ ‭1‬:‭8‬ ‭NLT‬‬==

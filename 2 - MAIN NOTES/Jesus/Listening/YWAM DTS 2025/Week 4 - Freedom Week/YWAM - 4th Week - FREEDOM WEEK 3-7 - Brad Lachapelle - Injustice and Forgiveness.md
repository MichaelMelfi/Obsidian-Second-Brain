# YWAM - 4th Week - FREEDOM WEEK - 3-7 - Brad Lachapelle - Injustice and Forgiveness

Lauren Cunningham says that “the one thing she has seen that takes people away from Christ and church is offence and unforgiveness.”

Effects Of Injustice
[[IMG_5510.jpg]]

An injustice is something that hurt us that we didn’t deserve
- Bad Words
- Rejection
- Hurtful Actions

It is not Gods heart for this to happen it is the enemy’s, but He cares about it and wants to save you from it and heal you.

Jesus died for the sins you commit and all sins that are committed against you.
He took that injustice for you not just your sin and sickness.

The cycle is:
1. We are created in the image of God
2. We are wounded
3. We react to that wound
4. We wound others in the way we were hurt

#### A VICTIM MENTALITY IS DEADLY

The story of Joseph is a great example of this. [[Preaching Ideas - Planted NOT Burried - Forgiveness]]
Joseph was thrown into prison, sold into slavery and had LOADS of injustices against him but was still faithful to God and even through it all he did not a victimise himself.
Through Josephs forgiveness Israel was continued and also prospered and also Jesus came from Josephs blood line.

There was a lady who was in a concentration camp
She became a pastor
And one of the officers who she remembered was one of the curliest came to her church and accepted the gospel.
He came forward and asked for her to pray for him that he is forgiven by God and by her for everything he did to the Jewish people (He did not recognise her but she recognised him)
She didn’t want to forgive him but she said Jesus if you can forgive him then i can to.
And by faith she forgave him and grabbed his hand and prayed for him.
She said she felt the love of God and that it went from her hand to her heart.
Forgiveness is not about our feelings
Faith first, feelings second.

God wants to be your friend
He wants to fill that hole someone else created
He wants to take away that sting and hurt
He wants to fill you with love
He wants to fill you with peace

Practical steps for forgiveness:

Forgiveness is releasing the debt and hoping they get what they don’t deserve because Jesus gave us what we didn’t deserve
Unforgiveness is hoping they get what they deserve

Joseph named his sons
Ephraim which means - Fruitfulness
And Mannaseh which means - He who forgets
This means that he named his sons ‘I will forget every injustice and be fruitful through everything and anything’

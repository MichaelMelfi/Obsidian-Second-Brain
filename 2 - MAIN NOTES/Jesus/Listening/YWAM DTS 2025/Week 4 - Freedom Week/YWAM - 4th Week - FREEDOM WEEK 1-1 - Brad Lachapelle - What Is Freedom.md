If the enemy cannot steal your salvation he will try and steal your calling.

> “The thief’s purpose is to steal and kill and destroy. My purpose is to give them a rich and satisfying life.”
‭‭==John‬ ‭10‬:‭10‬ ‭NLT‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/116/jhn.10.10.NLT

Jesus didn’t die so you could be bound
Jesus was bound so you could be free

Our inheritance is freedom but its our choice to take hold of it

> “And he did rescue us from mortal danger, and he will rescue us again. We have placed our confidence in him, and he will continue to rescue us.”
==‭‭2 Corinthians‬ ‭1‬:‭10‬ ‭NLT‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/116/2co.1.10.NLT

1. Jesus has delivered us and we are delivered from the penalty and accusation of sin.

We are secure in the salvation of Jesus Christ.

> “So now there is no condemnation for those who belong to Christ Jesus.”
‭‭==Romans‬ ‭8‬:‭1‬ ‭NLT‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/116/rom.8.1.NLT

2. Jesus is delivering us from the power of sin.
Before Jesus we are slaves to sin (Our master).

3. Jesus will deliver us from eternal sin (Hell)


Having freedom FIRST you must have been in a war or have been held captive.

Once you are saved you actually belong to Jesus it calls us slaves to God.
The enemy therefore has no authority or say over your life and cannot do anything without Gods say.
the enemy can talk to us and try to sway us but they cannot actually get us to do anything or force us to do anything without Gods say.

> “The Son radiates God’s own glory and expresses the very character of God, and he sustains everything by the mighty power of his command. When he had cleansed us from our sins, he sat down in the place of honor at the right hand of the majestic God in heaven.”
‭‭==Hebrews‬ ‭1‬:‭3‬ ‭NLT‬‬==

Jesus has all power and when we get saved because of the Cross Jesus gives us His power which was the Holy Spirit.

How confident would you walk if you knew Jesus was walking beside you?

> “But in fact, it is best for you that I go away, because if I don’t, the Advocate won’t come. If I do go away, then I will send him to you.”
‭‭==John‬ ‭16‬:‭7‬ ‭NLT‬‬==

When Jesus resurrected it says that he disarmed the weapons of the enemy.

We sing songs like Holy Forevers bridge, and need to know that God is above all!
And we are seated with him.

Story of the policeman who tries to stop the car.
The policeman has the authority to stop the car but not the power.
Now if the policeman was in a tank he has the authority and also the power to stop the car.
We have authority and power over Satan.

Abraham Lincoln sign the contract to free all slaves.
Because it was the old times and it was all on horses some towns took a few weeks to hear about the news.
One town in Texas took 2 years to hear the news
They were free for 2 years but were still in bondage and didn’t even know it!

Jesus died 2000 years ago and sign the contract to save and set us all free.
But some people haven’t heard this yet and don’t believe it!
He said that we must go and tell people the Good News!

If there is someone possessed in front of you
Ask their name, and who they are and then if they have made Jesus the Lord of their life, if not then get them to accept him
then declare the word of God
‘LEAVE IN THE MIGHTY NAME OF JESUS’
‘YOU HAVE NO AUTHORITY HERE’
Then take him through the 4 R’s
Repent
Release
Rebuke
Replace

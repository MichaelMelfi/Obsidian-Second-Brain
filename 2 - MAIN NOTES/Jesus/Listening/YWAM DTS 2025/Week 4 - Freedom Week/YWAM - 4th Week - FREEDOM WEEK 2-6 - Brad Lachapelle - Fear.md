# YWAM - 4th Week - FREEDOM WEEK 2-6 - Brad Lachapelle - Fear

Examples of living in fear:

Unbelief is the opposite of Faith
Unbelief says:
- God Cant
- God Wont
- God Does Not

Faith says
- God Can
- God Does
- God Will

Example is Israel going into the promise land.
Even after everything God did for them to get them freedom, Bread falling from the sky, The water splitting, The pillar of Fire.
But they still have unbelief that they would make it out.
People will think that the more they see the more faith they will have but this isnâ€™t true.
You cannot see a miracle but still have unbelief because the enemy sows unbelief.

Even though God said that he can, does and will give Israel the land, they were scared and leaned on their own wisdom of seeing the giants instead of the promises of God.

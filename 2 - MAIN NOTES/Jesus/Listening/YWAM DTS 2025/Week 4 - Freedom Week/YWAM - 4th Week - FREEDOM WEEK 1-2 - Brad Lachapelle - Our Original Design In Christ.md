Our original design vs what Satan tries to sow into your life:
[[AFF98612-A4BD-494E-86F8-CADAB422599B.jpg]]

God is not interested in your fallers
He is interested in your potential.

Ephesians 2:10 - we are His MASTER PIECE

Acts 17:26 - God created you for this time in this nation for His purposes.

Psalms 139:13 - He formed you personally, this shows how close and near he is to us.

Jeremiah 29:11 - Gods plan for your life is wholeness not brokenness

It is like a car, you have a McLaren p1 and it is fully customised.
But all you ever do with that car is drive it around a car park at 5mph
YOU ARE NOT USING THAT CAR TO ITS FULL POTENTIAL, its original design.
When you accept God into your life and you realise what you can do he will let you loose.

#### How do you know your original design?
1. **The bible**

2. **Seek The Lord Yourself**
You can get all the prophetic words but not believe it yourself
You can always hear things but you must believe it yourself for there to be change.

3. **Seek The Lord Within The Church**
The bible says desire spiritual gifts and especially prophesy.

> “But one who prophesies strengthens others, encourages them, and comforts them.”
==‭‭1 Corinthians‬ ‭14‬:‭3‬ ‭NLT‬‬==

##### When God says something Your MUST
1. Receive 
2. Believe 
3. Act
Or it is empty words that will fall to the floor

### How to teach the Gift of Joyful Repentance or the 4 R’s
The Gift of Repentance
[[IMG_5496.jpg]] 

Repentance is a gift because we get to trade:
death for Life
Bondage for Freedom
Heaviness for Joy
Anxiety for Peace
Our Own Way for His Way
Our Own Plans and Purposes for His plans and Purposes

Repentance shouldn’t be sad!
It should be happy because you are receiving the above!

But true repentance requires change and is life change.
You cannot be truly sorry if you carry on doing that thing.

### THE FOUR R’S
[[IMG_5497.jpg]]
1. Repent
2. Receive
- You must fully believe you are forgiven yourself
3. Rebuke
- You cannot rebuke by whispering or talking nicely.
- You must act like Satan is in front of you and you are shouting at him.
- It says the ”Kingdom forcefully advances” so that means it isn’t a nice kind advance!
4. Replace

#### Do you want Jesus more than you want your sin?

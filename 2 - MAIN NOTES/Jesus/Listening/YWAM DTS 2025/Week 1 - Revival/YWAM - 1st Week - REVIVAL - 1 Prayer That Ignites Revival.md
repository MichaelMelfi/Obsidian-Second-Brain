# YWAM - 1st Week - Prayer That Ignites Revival

The Word revival comes from Revive because it’s about reviving the nation and bringing it back to life from death.


Just information won’t help or save you. 

Using what you have learnt is what will cause a reaction.

  

1989 there was a study of 300 different locations that had revival either poor or rich all in different locations and countries and they wanted to find out what happened before the revival.

They found one thing the same in every place and it was that is started with an unusual unified prayer.

What we mean by unusual is that they pray as a group ALOT. Not your quiet time but together as a group.

Quote from DR A.T.Pierson

Where do we see revival in the Bible?

The word revival is not in the bible but the bible is filled with stories of it.

  

Like josiah where they lost the bible but found one then there was a revival.

  

The best story of revival is Jesus story.

In capurnam

Acts 19 in efises

John 3

  

Revival was normal in the early church of ACTS

  

In 34AD at the start of the church there were 120 despises/christians in the upper room

  

In 100AD it is approximated 25,000 Christians.

  

Then in 313AD it is approximated at 20,000,000 Christians

DURING THE ROMAN EMPIRE WHEN TOUR WERE KILLED TO BE A CHRISTIAN, you were out in the collision and fed to lions.

  

Then Constantine the emperor turned Christian and made the Roman church.

# YWAM - 1st Week - 2 Revival in Korea

Acts‬ ‭2‬:‭17‬-‭19‬ ‭NKJV‬‬

“‘And it shall come to pass in the last days, says God, That I will pour out of My Spirit on all flesh; Your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, Your young men shall see visions, Your old men shall dream dreams. And on My menservants and on My maidservants I will pour out My Spirit in those days; And they shall prophesy. I will show wonders in heaven above And signs in the earth beneath: Blood and fire and vapor of smoke.”

‭‭

In Korea - they have a very similar history to Cambodia

  

They were very against Christians, the leaders kept killing missionaries and any Christian’s they found.

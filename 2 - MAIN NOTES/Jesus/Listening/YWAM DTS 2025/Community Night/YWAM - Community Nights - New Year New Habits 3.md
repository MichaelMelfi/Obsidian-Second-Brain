#### Healthy Lifestyle

The bible is truth
In a world full of lies

> “And what do you benefit if you gain the whole world but are yourself lost or destroyed?”

==Good health is my inheritance.==

#### Church of Corinth
Some of the people in Corinth believed that the spirit and the flesh are completely separate.
It doesn’t matter what you do in the flesh as nothing effects the spirit as long as you are worshiping God so they were sinning everywhere.

So Paul said this to them.

> “And don’t you realize that if a man joins himself to a prostitute, he becomes one body with her? For the Scriptures say, “The two are united into one.” But the person who is joined to the Lord is one spirit with him. Run from sexual sin! No other sin so clearly affects the body as this one does. For sexual immorality is a sin against your own body. Don’t you realize that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit, who lives in you and was given to you by God? You do not belong to yourself,”
‭‭==1 Corinthians‬ ‭6‬:‭16‬-‭19‬ ‭NLT‬‬==

Our body either glorifies God of Defies God.

We are blessed with the body God gave us.
Some people cannot walk. 
Some people cannot Run.
Some people cannot talk.

Don’t take your body for granted.

How valuable is your health?
How much would you pay to be well if you are sick?
Jesus already pre payed your bill for you on the Cross.

FASTING - The secret weapon of spiritual growth

Matthew‬ ‭6‬:‭16‬-‭18‬ ‭NLT‬‬

““And when you fast, don’t make it obvious, as the hypocrites do, for they try to look miserable and disheveled so people will admire them for their fasting. I tell you the truth, that is the only reward they will ever get. But when you fast, comb your hair and wash your face. Then no one will notice that you are fasting, except your Father, who knows what you do in private. And your Father, who sees everything, will reward you.”

‭‭

It says ‘When you fast’

This means you have a choice but it’s something every Christian has to do.

  

Fasting is saying no to food so you can say yes to God.

  

I am more hungry for Jesus than I am for food

I will eat the words of Jesus instead of food.

Feeding my spirit and not my flesh.

  

  

When do you fast?

  

Fast in preparation

Moses, Jesus and Paul all has times of fasting in preparation for what comes next

  

  

When we need spiritual realignment

Joel‬ ‭2‬:‭12‬-‭13‬ ‭NLT‬‬

“That is why the Lord says, “Turn to me now, while there is time. Give me your hearts. Come with fasting, weeping, and mourning. Don’t tear your clothing in your grief, but tear your hearts instead.” Return to the Lord your God, for he is merciful and compassionate, slow to get angry and filled with unfailing love. He is eager to relent and not punish.”

Humbling yourself to the Lord

We make ourselves weaker so God can make us stronger and rely on him.

When we need breakthrough or change

Esther‬ ‭4‬:‭16‬ ‭NLT‬‬

““Go and gather together all the Jews of Susa and fast for me. Do not eat or drink for three days, night or day. My maids and I will do the same. And then, though it is against the law, I will go in to see the king. If I must die, I must die.””

The breakthrough in our lives, might be through someone else’s life

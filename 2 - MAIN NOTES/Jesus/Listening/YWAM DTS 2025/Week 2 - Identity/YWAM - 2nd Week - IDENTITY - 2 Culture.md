# YWAM - 2nd Week - IDENTITY - Culture

8 billion people made up of about 200 countries

  

What are the similarities?

In all cultures there are 3 similarities:

1. Love
2. Acceptance
3. Happiness

  

Satan wants to attack unity because if we are separate, he can pick us off.

  

Focus on unity not what makes you different.

  

You can separate Cultures in two categories

1. Cold Climate Culture

In Cold culture they thrive from being by themselves and only worrying about them.

In cold culture they prefer to have a small group

They will always line up

They are very direct with answers and how they speak, ask and answer. They don’t beat around the bush

  

1. Hot Climate Culture

In Hot culture they thrive with being in a community and helping each other

Hot culture they prefer to be in a big group

They will always clump together and there is no order

They will beat around the bush with answers and questioning

  

  

There is kingdom culture / The Beatitudes

  

|   |   |
|---|---|
|““Blessed are the poor in spirit, For theirs is the kingdom of heaven.|This is talking about spiritual poverty, knowing that you entirely rely on God and his favour and grace HUMILITY|
|Blessed are those who mourn, For they shall be comforted.|This is not talking about mourning when someone dies.                    This is a mourning for the individual or sins of the world.                         Be sad for those who don’t follow Jesus|
|Blessed are the meek, For they shall inherit the earth.|Meekness is the temper of your spirit in situations. The word Cross in Hebrew is the same as the word meek. The meek it is talking about is following and obeying God|
|Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, For they shall be filled.|Hunger and thirst are in the present tense. This is saying we need to be constantly hungry and thirst for God|
|Blessed are the merciful, For they shall obtain mercy.|Elamon is the Greek word for Mercy. This is someone who is actively looking to show and receive mercy|
|Blessed are the pure in heart, For they shall see God.|Pure in Greek is Katharos, meaning a heart that is unmixed. We must not be distracted by the world or thoughts of the flesh but only Gods way.|
|Blessed are the peacemakers, For they shall be called sons of God.|We want to be people who try and make peace and not war.|
|Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness’ sake, For theirs is the kingdom of heaven.”|Kingdom culture is different. There is no other culture like it. If we truly live out Kingdom culture we will be different and be persecuted for how different we are.|

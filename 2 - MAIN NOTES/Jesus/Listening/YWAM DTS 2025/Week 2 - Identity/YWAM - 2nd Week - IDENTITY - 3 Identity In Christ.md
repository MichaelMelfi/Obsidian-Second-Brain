# YWAM - 2nd Week - IDENTITY - Identity In Christ

Who am I? 

a child of god

  

Where am I from? 

London

  

What am I doing? 

Saving lives and Diving deeper into Gods word and becoming in destructible

  

Where am I going?

Where-ever I’m called

  

Why am I on this earth?

To fulfill the great commission; To save the lost, heal the sick, and give God glory

1. God made us and we belong to the most high God

““For you are a holy people to the Lord your God; the Lord your God has chosen you to be a people for Himself, a special treasure above all the peoples on the face of the earth.”

Deuteronomy‬ ‭7‬:‭6‬ ‭NKJV‬

God knew us before we were even a thought in the world.

  

  

Story:

I go to school with lunch my mum made but I leave it in my bag and don’t eat it.

The next day she prepares it again and I do the same and don’t eat it.

This happens every day and the food that was once ready to eat and fresh is now old and mouldy.

  

This is like God preparing the word every day but we do not read or digest it so what God set up for us one day has now got rotten and isn’t fresh/ripe anymore.

  

Make sure to eat everything God gives you.

Because if you try and catch up on what you have missed it wont taste or be the same.

# YWAM - 2nd Week - IDENTITY

From Pastor Randy White and his wife Anita.

  

Housefires worship came from their ministry.

IDENTITY

““Look! The virgin will conceive a child! She will give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel, which means ‘God is with us.’””

‭‭Matthew‬ ‭1‬:‭23‬ ‭NLT‬‬

  

The New Testament was written in Greek but Immanuel is a Hebrew word which is what the Old Testament was written in.

  

Matthew specifically translated the word Immanuel because he wants us to know what it means.

  

GOD IS WITH US

  

There will be hard days and battles but you must remember these words.

  

Who is my advocate?

  

“Jesus came and told his disciples, “I have been given all authority in heaven and on earth. Therefore, go and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. Teach these new disciples to obey all the commands I have given you. And be sure of this: I am with you always, even to the end of the age.””

‭‭Matthew‬ ‭28‬:‭18‬-‭20‬ ‭NLT‬‬

  

Inside these verse, He says the most important part is that ‘He is with us always even to the end of the age’.

  

  

Identify what you are confident at and what God has gifted you with that you need to grow in.

  

You are never too important for what God wants you to do. No matter how big or small the calling is.

  

  

  

ASBURY REVIVAL

  

Asbury got a new president a couple of months before the revival

They were very much struggling with sexuality and all schools where saying you can do what you want and be what you want before this president but the new president stopped this and a third of the students came and did a protest because of this but the president didn’t give in and kept with Gods word.

  

WE MUST look at the world through the lens of the bible

DO NOT look at the Bible through the lens of the world

  

This then meant that a lot of students left the schools but then the students who didn’t leave started to pray for the student leaving.

  

4 student had been praying for revival every day for 4 years.

  

Then from those 4 praying students praying the revival started.

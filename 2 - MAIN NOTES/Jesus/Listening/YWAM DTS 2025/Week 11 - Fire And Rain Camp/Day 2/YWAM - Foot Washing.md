2000 years ago Jesus was washing feet.
He was washing His disciples feet and we still do it today.
We must understand what it actually means though.
And how powerful it is.

Feet are usually seen as disgusting and sticky.

### Spiritually feet are:
Our feet are not dirty.
> “And how are they to preach unless they are sent? As it is written, “How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the good news!””
‭‭==Romans‬ ‭10‬:‭15‬ ‭ESV‬‬==

Our feet have been washed by Jesus.

What do we do with our feet?
We walk
We jump
We run
And the same way we do all of this we do it while we share the gospel.
We can’t walk and run without feet.
We don’t crawl, we are not babies.
We are mighty men and woman of God
We were birth from death to life
We were born from hell to heaven
We were cleansed and cleaned
Because Jesus sent someone at one time told us about the gospel

When we wash feet, we are washing the temple of the Holy Spirit 1 Corinthians.
Old Testament Washing feet was for preasts going into the temple
New Testament it’s about constant spiritual cleansing
The temple has gone from external to internal

All because of the cross.

We now don’t need a preast, we don’t need anyone else to connect us to God
He dwells inside us when we accept Him.
When you talk to people, they should not see you but see a walking, talking, breathing, living temple of the Holy Spirit

Because the tables were so low in the house, the servant would wash the family’s feet so the tables would not be dirty.

When you wash another believers feet, you are honouring them, you are honouring the temple and you are honouring God.

When you do it you become servants and leaders.
Leaders because we are released.
Leaders because we kneel and don’t seek the top.
You humble yourself.
You should not use your power you have to impress other people but only to show God glory.

Jesus cleaned the disciples feet hours before He died.
He cleaned them as a launching and an equipping and a start of a new thing

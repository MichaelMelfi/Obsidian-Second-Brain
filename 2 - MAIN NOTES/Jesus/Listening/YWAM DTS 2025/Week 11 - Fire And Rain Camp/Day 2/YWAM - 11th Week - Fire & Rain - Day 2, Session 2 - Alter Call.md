Your whole message should build to the alter call.
This is the the moment or time where they choose to follow God

Genesis 24

Romans 10
Confess with your mouth

The alter call is the invite to come to Jesus
We know where the party is but we must hand out the invitations so people will go

### Urgency
You do not know, this might be the last time they will ever be told the gospel before they die.
DL moody, his last preach he did at his church before a massive hurricane that killed loads, he did not do an alter call and regretted it forever as he knew some of the people in the audience had not yet accepted Jesus.
Itâ€™s about telling them the truth.
This is a life and death choice.
If you do not give them the option to follow Jesus, you are choosing the answer for them and that answer is no.

### Passion and Conviction

### Confidence
You are a representative of the Kingdom of Heaven.
Whatever you do or where ever you go, you are going in the name of Jesus.
If you saw someone in a fire, would just ask them tot please leave the fire or in your own time come out of that fire when you have a chance.
No you would force them out. You would be shouting. You are going to burn if you stay in that building, come out now!

### Tenacity
If your loved ones were about to jump off a cliff of bridge, you would be doing everything you can to stop them. You would be holding onto their legs and not letting go!
### Honesty

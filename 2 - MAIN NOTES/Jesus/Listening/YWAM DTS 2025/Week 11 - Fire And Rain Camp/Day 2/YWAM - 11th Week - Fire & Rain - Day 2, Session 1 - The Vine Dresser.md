> ““I am the true vine, and my Father is the vinedresser. Every branch in me that does not bear fruit he takes away, and every branch that does bear fruit he prunes, that it may bear more fruit. Already you are clean because of the word that I have spoken to you. Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in me. I am the vine; you are the branches. Whoever abides in me and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing.”
‭‭==John‬ ‭15‬:‭1‬-‭5‬ ‭ESV‬‬==

The purpose of a vine is to bear fruit.
God loves to see fruit in our lives, it is the sign of a healthy plant.
He is the best gardener who can get fruit from any plant.

## 3 things a vine dresser does.
### Prune the vines (cut off dead ones)
God is a good God, we can trust Him when it comes to prune.

Instead of asking God to cut off/prune the bad fruit.
Ask Him to prune the root/vine.
Instead of asking God for patience, ask God to prune the thing causing the impatience.

If you do not prune a plant, the bad vine can grow roots and can cause the other good ones to die aswell

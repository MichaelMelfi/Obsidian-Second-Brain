Revelations 2

There was the war in the Philippines and the new came out that the war was over so everyone got sent home but there was one soldier who didn’t believe it and thought it was a trick of the enemy and a spy so kept on fighting. His family kept on asking him to come home but he didn’t believe anything.
It ended up that the general had to come and get him and tell him that the war was over.

I am the general who tells the soldiers who have heard the good news but don’t believe it.

1 John 4:4

I have built my life on how much I love God.
But it is about how much He loves us.

We cannot match anything close to His love.
The love we walk it is nothing compared to the love that God has for us.
If you can walk in Gods love for you, not your love for Hod, you will not just run fast but you will run for ever and ever and ever.

2 different people who loved in different ways
Peter
Matthew 26:5
Though I should die with you, 

John built his life on how much Jesus loved him. It doesn’t say that John loved Jesus but always how much Jesus loved John.
He was the only one that stayed with Jesus till the very end and was at the feet of Jesus on the Cross.

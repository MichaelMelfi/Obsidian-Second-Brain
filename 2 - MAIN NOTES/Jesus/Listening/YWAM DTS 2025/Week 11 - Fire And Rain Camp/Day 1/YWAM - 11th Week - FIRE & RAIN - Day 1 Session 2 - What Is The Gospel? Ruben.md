If you don’t know the gospel, how can you share it?

> “For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.”
‭‭==Romans‬ ‭1‬:‭16‬ ‭ESV‬‬==

When you preach the gospel, it isn’t normal words.
Power follows you, people get healed, lives change, chains break.
The gospel works!

A lot of the time we teach a Luke warm gospel or half truths.
But this isn’t the power of God.
If I say Jesus loves you, that is true but.That isn’t the gospel.
I know lots of people who know God loves them but they have no power.

Just like pilot put Jesus before the parasites and asked what will you do with Jesus.
Our goal is to give people Jesus and ask them “What will you do with Jesus?”

### What is the good news?
It is like medicine. They are sick and need healing!

It is firstly GOOD:
The world tell you, someone has to loose for someone else to win but the Gospel/good news is everyone wins.

It is secondly NEWS:
This means that it has already happened and we are reporting on it.

In Roman times.
When a new king was appointed or there was a battle and a dictator was over thrown and a new king was put in power.
They would send out messengers and say there is GOOD NEWS THE NEW KING IS HERE.

### What is the gospel?
#### Gods original design the perfect design 
Man had authority there was No sin, no sickness, no death, no shame it was to be in relationship with Him.

#### Broken world
Adam and Eve sinned and gave authority over to satan and sickness, death, shame came into the world.

#### Life of Jesus
The Son Of God came and humbled himself, He lived the perfect life, He did not sin, He served people He didn’t have to but he came down to earth but because He loved us so much He did just that.

#### Death and burial
The wages of sin is death.
Jesus never sinned, He should never have died, it should have been impossible for Him to die.
But because He loved us so much He died for us, He took all the wages that we earned from being sinful.
He died the most gruesome death, he was beaten, whipped and publicly shamed and stripped.
Isiah, He was unrecognisable as a human being.
He did not earn this he did not deserve it and didn’t have to do it but He did it for you.
He did it so you do not have to.
He took your sin so you can be righteous.
He became sick so you can be healed.
When he took His last breath he said “It is finished”.
What Jesus did, it is completed, it is done, there is nothing else to do!

#### Resurrection HE IS ALIVE
3 days later he rose again and is alive today and is offering you salvation!
All these religions as trusting in a dead man but we believe in an alive man who is alive and speaking and working miracles today.

#### Faith
This is something we can only show someone
It is like a gift, if I give you a gift of a million dollars
There are two options you can either believe that there is a million dollars in the box and open it and use it.
The other option is that you believe it is too good to be true that you don’t even open the box and throw it away.
Faith is saying Jesus you died for my sins.
Faith is knowing you don’t need to earn Gods goodness or forgiveness or love.
If we could earn it, it wouldn’t be good.
If it’s about how many good things we do on earth, heaven would not be a good place.
Everyone would be comparing in heaven and it would be full of jealousy.
But because we know Jesus did the good, it’s not about us.

#### Repentance
You must tell them to repent.
This is a joyful gift!
It is not sad
Repentance literally just means changing your ways.

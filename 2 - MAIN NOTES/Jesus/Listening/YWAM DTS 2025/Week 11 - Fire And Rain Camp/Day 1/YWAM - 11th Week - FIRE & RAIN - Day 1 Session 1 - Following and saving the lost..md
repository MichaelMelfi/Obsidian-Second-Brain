We were once enemy’s of God.
We are now through Jesus’ blood and salvation, friends of God.
A disciple is someone who actively imitates and reflects God

> There is an old Jewish maxim that goes something like this: “May you be covered in the dust of your rabbi.” (See addendum 8/11/2023, below.) The idea behind the saying is that a rabbi’s disciples were to follow him so closely that as they walked with him, their own feet would become caked with the dust from his sandals.

It is said that disciples of rabies followed so closely to their rabie that when the rabie would walk in sand, the sand would be hitting the followers.
We need to be so close to Jesus and following Jesus so closely that his sand, water and anointing is hitting us

Old Testament:
When God moved the people moved

New Testament:
The people move so God can move.
His is waiting for us to say yes and go so He may work through us.

Don’t think your calling is cheap.
Do not treat it that way.
Your calling is just as important than everyone else’s.
You are the best person for that calling, you were made specifically for that calling. But it’s your choice whether your choose to follow it.

If you are playing with sin and thinking that it doesn’t harm you. 
You are saying that you know better than God.

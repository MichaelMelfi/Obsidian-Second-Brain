The bible says 
> “Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.”
‭‭==Hebrews‬ ‭4‬:‭16‬ ‭ESV‬‬==

With Confidence! Another translation says boldly.
We should be able to run to God and say “Father!”
We should be able to come with courage to our father

People think if we are good enough THEN and ONLY THEN we will get accepted by God but this is not right
Nothing we can do will ever be enough

But must know this in revelation though, it cannot be head knowledge.
It must be heart knowledge otherwise it does not come out to other people right.

### Value and Worth
How do we revive value at human beings from the worlds point of view.

For  MEN:
that we must be strong or smart how much money you have, if we are important, how much we get messaged or called.

For WOMAN: 
How beautiful you are, married yet, how many children you have, what does your husband do.

These things then start becoming idols in our life.
Like social media.

But as a Christian and follower of God
We must only be a slave to one this and that is CHRIST.
Our value comes from CHRIST and nothing else.
We are His Doulos slave.
Once you are in that position you are indestructible.
This is because if your value comes from Christ then it doesn’t matter what happens around you and what people say, it cannot bring you down or up.

He made us for family.
He is all love and because He is all love he wants to share His love.

He is, however, both judge and father

Your kids pick up on what you say. 
The more your kid is around you the more they copy your characteristics and words and actions.
This is the same with you and God
The more you say around and talk with God the more you act the same and talk the same.

Sometimes you act like an orphan when you have a father right there.

> ““I will not leave you as orphans; I will come to you.”
‭‭==John‬ ‭14‬:‭18‬ ‭ESV‬‬==

He gives us a spirit of adoption.

Surround yourself with people who give you something and rub off on you.

someone might bring out your spirit of faith
Someone might bring out your spirit of excellence
Someone might bring out your spirit of love
Etc etc etc

When you are with your parents you do not call them by their names but by their title, mum and dad
This is the same with God
Some people are so not used to actually calling God dad or father.

Fillayo love - love between two friends
Agapey love - unconditional love
Aros love - sexual love

If we do not get Agapey love when we are younger then you will find love in aros or fillayo love.

We are the bridge of Christ not from a gender point of view but because we join Christs family as the bridge joins the grooms family.

We are Sons of God because the son always get the birthright and will of the father.
An orphan feels like they have to prove themselves
A son knows he is going to get his birthright or father will no matter what they have done.

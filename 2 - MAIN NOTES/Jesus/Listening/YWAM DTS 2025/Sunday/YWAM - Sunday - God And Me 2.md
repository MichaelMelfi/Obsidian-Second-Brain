### My Inheritance Through Christ:
**Definition:** Something promised by someone alive but received upon death.

Inheritance isn’t just money!
We have kingdom inheritance

> “In Him also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestined according to the purpose of Him who works all things according to the counsel of His will, that we who first trusted in Christ should be to the praise of His glory.”
‭‭==Ephesians‬ ‭1‬:‭11‬-‭12‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/eph.1.11-12.NKJV

> “In Him you also trusted, after you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation; in whom also, having believed, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise, who is the guarantee of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, to the praise of His glory.”
‭‭==Ephesians‬ ‭1‬:‭13‬-‭14‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==

When you give a deposit to something you know for sure that you will receive that product.

This is the same as Jesus.
You make a deposit which is accepting Jesus as Lord and Jesus stamps that contract meaning you will get that inheritance.

Once the contract has been signed and stamped it cannot be in signed, it is a life long contract.

### Our inheritance is God himself
But what is that?

1. Spiritual adoption
- Our inheritance is as believers adopted children of God

> “having predestined us to adoption as sons by Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will,”
‭‭==Ephesians‬ ‭1‬:‭5‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/eph.1.5.NKJV

> “For you did not receive the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you received the Spirit of adoption by whom we cry out, “Abba, Father.””
‭‭==Romans‬ ‭8‬:‭15‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/rom.8.15.NKJV

#### For the believer earth is the closest thing we will experience to Hell
#### For the unbeliever earth is the closest thing they will experience to Heaven

1. The kingdom of God
- we are heirs to the Kingdom of God

> “And He put all things under His feet, and gave Him to be head over all things to the church, which is His body, the fullness of Him who fills all in all.”
‭‭==Ephesians‬ ‭1‬:‭22‬-‭23‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/eph.1.22-23.NKJV

> “Then the King will say to those on His right hand, ‘Come, you blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:”
‭‭==Matthew‬ ‭25‬:‭34‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/mat.25.34.NKJV


1. Gods Grace
- we inherit the riches of Gods Grace

> “In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of His grace which He made to abound toward us in all wisdom and prudence,”
‭‭==Ephesians‬ ‭1‬:‭7‬-‭8‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/eph.1.7-8.NKJV


1. We Are A New Creation
- Our inheritance is we are transformed into new creations in Christ.


> “Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ, just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before Him in love,”
‭‭==Ephesians‬ ‭1‬:‭3‬-‭4‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/eph.1.3-4.NKJV

> “Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new.”
==‭‭II Corinthians‬ ‭5‬:‭17‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/2co.5.17.NKJV


1. Peace, Hope and Joy



> “for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.”
‭‭==Romans‬ ‭14‬:‭17‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/rom.14.17.NKJV


1. Access to God



> “Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need.”
‭‭==Hebrews‬ ‭4‬:‭16‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/heb.4.16.NKJV


> “that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Him, the eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that you may know what is the hope of His calling, what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints,”
> ‭‭==Ephesians‬ ‭1‬:‭17‬-‭18‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/eph.1.17-18.NKJV

https://bible.com/bible/114/eph.1.14.NKJV

‭‭==Acts‬ ‭2‬:‭42‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/act.2.42.NKJV


1. Resurrection

> “which He worked in Christ when He raised Him from the dead and seated Him at His right hand in the heavenly places,”
‭‭==Ephesians‬ ‭1‬:‭20‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/eph.1.20.NKJV



### How do we receive this inheritance?

> “But if there is no resurrection of the dead, then Christ is not risen. And if Christ is not risen, then our preaching is empty and your faith is also empty. Yes, and we are found false witnesses of God, because we have testified of God that He raised up Christ, whom He did not raise up—if in fact the dead do not rise. For if the dead do not rise, then Christ is not risen. And if Christ is not risen, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins!”
==‭‭I Corinthians‬ ‭15‬:‭13‬-‭17‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/1co.15.13-17.NKJV


Do we really understand the gospel?

Jesus’s resurrection is the stamp/signature to our deposit.


> “and what is the exceeding greatness of His power toward us who believe, according to the working of His mighty power which He worked in Christ when He raised Him from the dead and seated Him at His right hand in the heavenly places,”
‭‭==Ephesians‬ ‭1‬:‭19‬-‭20‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/eph.1.19-20.NKJV


To give the best inheritance to the next generation, we must first receive the inheritance.
We cannot give what we haven’t first received 

Inheritance = Authority and Responsibility


> “that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Him, the eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that you may know what is the hope of His calling, what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints,”
‭‭==Ephesians‬ ‭1‬:‭17‬-‭18‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/eph.1.17-18.NKJV

# YWAM - Sunday - New Year New Man
Take off your old self and put on your new self.

  

Our bodies will be the same but it’s about taking off our old habits, old mind, old things and put on the new mind for 2025 and be transformed into the new person.

  

Ephesians‬ ‭4‬:‭17‬-‭19‬ ‭NKJV‬‬

“This I say, therefore, and testify in the Lord, that you should no longer walk as the rest of the Gentiles walk, in the futility of their mind, having their understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God, because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart; who, being past feeling, have given themselves over to lewdness, to work all uncleanness with greediness.”

‭

This is talking about the old church transforming into a new church that they will be enlightened.

  

Ephesians‬ ‭4‬:‭20‬-‭22‬ ‭NKJV‬‬

“But you have not so learned Christ, if indeed you have heard Him and have been taught by Him, as the truth is in Jesus: that you put off, concerning your former conduct, the old man which grows corrupt according to the deceitful lusts,”

  

  

What is your old self?

Now right down your old self and tear it up and throw is at the base of the cross

Ephesians‬ ‭4‬:‭25‬-‭27‬ ‭NKJV‬‬

“Therefore, putting away lying, “Let each one of you speak truth with his neighbor,” for we are members of one another. “Be angry, and do not sin”: do not let the sun go down on your wrath, nor give place to the devil.”

‭‭

  

Ephesians‬ ‭4‬:‭28‬-‭30‬ ‭NKJV‬‬

“Let him who stole steal no longer, but rather let him labor, working with his hands what is good, that he may have something to give him who has need. Let no corrupt word proceed out of your mouth, but what is good for necessary edification, that it may impart grace to the hearers. And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.”

‭‭

  

Ephesians‬ ‭4‬:‭31‬-‭32‬ ‭NKJV‬‬

“Let all bitterness, wrath, anger, clamor, and evil speaking be put away from you, with all malice. And be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God in Christ forgave you.”

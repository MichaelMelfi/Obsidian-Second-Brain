# YWAM - Sunday- New Year New Habits
### What Is A Habit?
- A settled or regular tendency or practice, especially one that is hard to give up.
- A habit is something that you are comfortable with.
- Something you don’t have to think about before doing.

#### Bad Habits
1. **HATE**
- (not all hate is bad) but hate towards people.
- Jesus equates those who hate his brother as if you’ve killed them

2. **PRIDE**
- everything resolves around yourself.
- Pride becomes jealousy.
    (Cain killed Abel)
- Playing God and want to control others.
- It’s not my fault, it is someone else’s fault .
    (Adam blamed God)
- it destroys relationship with people around you and God.

3. **UNFORGIVENESS / VENGEANCE
- if you don’t forgive someone you are amplifying your hurt with bitterness which hurts you and others more.
- Unforgiveness is like poison it kills you from the inside.

4. **LUST**
- it starts with just looking at porn.
     (King David started with just looking and it lead to consequences)
- Jesus stated, if you just looking at woman with lust you have already committed adultery with her.
- Subjecting the image of God for your own pleasure.


#### What motivates you to get these things right?
1. Fear of Punishment
2. Out of Love
3. Gods Says It’s Wrong.

#### It Starts With God, This Is Spiritual Warfare!!

# YWAM - 8th Week - 2-1 - PRAYER - JESUS - SEAKMENG
### What Actually is Prayer?
The word **==euche==** is an old Greek word that describes a wish, desire, prayer, or vow. It was originally used to depict a person who made some kind of vow to God because of some need or desire in his or her life.

In the Bible, prayer is ==a way to communicate with God, ask for help, and experience God's closeness==. It's a two-way relationship where people can talk to God and listen to him. 

What does prayer mean in the Bible?
- **Communication**: Prayer is a way to talk to God, confess sins, and ask for needs and desires. 
- **Fellowship**: Prayer is a way to have a loving relationship with God, the creator of the universe.
- **Growth**: Prayer is a way to grow in intimacy with God. 
- **Asking**: Prayer is asking God to do what he has promised to do. 

- **Matthew 7:7**
    
    "Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you". 
    

How to pray 

Prayer can be audible or silent, private or public, formal or informal. It should be offered in faith, in the name of Jesus, and through the power of the Holy Spirit.
O
If we leave a worship time or a prayer time the same or discouraged this is a problem with us.
What have we done or not done.
God does not change and his presence changes all so what was then different the time you didn’t feel anything to when you did feel anything.

3 stages of prayer
Lord I Need You
Lord I Love You
Lord I Want You More

Prayer should not be a sad and silent thing!
It should be such a joyful experience, you are praying to the lord of lord and it says that everything you ask for will come to pass!

Do we need quiet time in the morning or is it okay having it at night?

Seeing below, Jesus always had quiet time in the morning.
Having it in the morning means that nothing can distract you.
It’s starts your day with God.
Do you truly love God and his presence if you prefer your bed than God?
Do you truly love God if you cannot wait to get out of bed in the morning to pray?
You cannot be on your phone at night
See being on the phone at night as stealing time away from God in the morning.
You are choosing your phone instead of God.
If you chose something over quiet time or pray time then that thing is above God in your life.
THAT NEEDS TO CHANGE
FACTS DON’T CARE ABOUT YOUR FEELINGS
YOU MUST DO THIS.

If you read 10 chapters a day, you can read the whole new Testiment in a month.
This can be 12 times in a year!
Spend a year devouring the new Testiment.

> “Where there is no prophetic vision the people cast off restraint, but blessed is he who keeps the law.”
‭‭==Proverbs‬ ‭29‬:‭18‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/pro.29.18.ESV

When there is no vision in your life you do not do anything.
### Jesus’ Prayer Life

Even Jesus prayed in the morning and all the time!

- Jesus would have woken up very early in the morning before the sunrise is before 5:30am
Maybe 4am? 4:30?
- Jesus would go to a desolate place where He is on his own with no distractions.
- In those days they did not have a bible, they would have to memories the books of the bible so.
- Jesus would have most likely been singing the psalms during his prayer times and walking.


> “And rising very early in the morning, while it was still dark, he departed and went out to a desolate place, and there he prayed.”
‭‭==Mark‬ ‭1‬:‭35‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/mrk.1.35.ESV

> “But now even more the report about him went abroad, and great crowds gathered to hear him and to be healed of their infirmities. But he would withdraw to desolate places and pray.”
‭‭==Luke‬ ‭5‬:‭15‬-‭16‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/luk.5.15-16.ESV

> “And Jesus said, “Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.” And they cast lots to divide his garments.”
‭‭==Luke‬ ‭23‬:‭34‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/luk.23.34.ESV

Prayer without faith is just words
Faith without prayer is just dreams

You must pray on your faith.
You must have faith for your prayer.
They both work hand in hand.
You cannot have one without the other.


There should be more prayer than anything you are doing in the physical.

A life of prayer is praying everywhere you go 24/7 and performing miracles in between your prayer.
This is like walking to different cities 24/7 and always moving.
The walk between the cities is prayer
The destination/city is the miracle.

What is the secret to life?
1. Prayer
2. Prayer
3. Prayer

### The Lords Prayer

> “Now Jesus was praying in a certain place, and when he finished, one of his disciples said to him, “Lord, teach us to pray, as John taught his disciples.””
‭‭==Luke‬ ‭11‬:‭1‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/luk.11.1.ESV
 [[Tape - Larry Lea - The Lord's Prayer]]

### Warfare
You have to win your battles in your secret place.
You must win your small battles so you can overcome the big battles.
We do not fight with flesh and blood but in the spirit with the sword of the spirit.
Fighting does not just include fighting for your own battles but also fighting for other people and your friends salvation.
How do you expect to fight others battles when you haven’t won against your own?

#### Armour Of The Lord
##### ==Ephesians‬ ‭6‬:‭10‬-‭20‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
> “Finally, be strong in the Lord and in the strength of his might. Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the schemes of the devil. For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers over this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places. Therefore take up the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand firm. Stand therefore, having fastened on the belt of truth, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness, and, as shoes for your feet, having put on the readiness given by the gospel of peace. In all circumstances take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming darts of the evil one; and take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God, praying at all times in the Spirit, with all prayer and supplication. To that end, keep alert with all perseverance, making supplication for all the saints, and also for me, that words may be given to me in opening my mouth boldly to proclaim the mystery of the gospel, for which I am an ambassador in chains, that I may declare it boldly, as I ought to speak.”

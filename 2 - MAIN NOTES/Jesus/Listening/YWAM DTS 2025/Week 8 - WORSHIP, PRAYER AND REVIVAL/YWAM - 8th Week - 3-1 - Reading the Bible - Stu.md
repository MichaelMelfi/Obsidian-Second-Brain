# YWAM - 8th Week - Reading the Bible - Stu

You must read the bible, whether it is quiet time or later.

## Why we should do quiet time
Prayer should not be a sad and silent thing!
It should be such a joyful experience, you are praying to the lord of lord and it says that everything you ask for will come to pass!

Do we need quiet time in the morning or is it okay having it at night?

Seeing below, Jesus always had quiet time in the morning.
Having it in the morning means that nothing can distract you.
It’s starts your day with God.
Do you truly love God and his presence if you prefer your bed than God?
Do you truly love God if you cannot wait to get out of bed in the morning to pray?
You cannot be on your phone at night
See being on the phone at night as stealing time away from God in the morning.
You are choosing your phone instead of God.
If you chose something over quiet time or pray time then that thing is above God in your life.
THAT NEEDS TO CHANGE
FACTS DON’T CARE ABOUT YOUR FEELINGS
YOU MUST DO THIS.

## Ways to read the bible
If you read 10 chapters a day, you can read the whole new Testiment in a month.
This can be 12 times in a year!
Spend a year devouring the new Testiment.

> “Where there is no prophetic vision the people cast off restraint, but blessed is he who keeps the law.”
‭‭==Proverbs‬ ‭29‬:‭18‬ ‭ESV‬‬==

When there is no vision in your life you do not do anything.

After reading the bible you must pray about what you’ve just read.
Pray it into your life.

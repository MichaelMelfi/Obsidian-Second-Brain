##### What Did I Learn From This Teaching?:
- Lay your foundation in your secret place (Prayer) Because the foundations are the bits that people cannot see, yet keep you standing through anything!
- The most important time is not in front of thousands but in your private prayer life.
- Your situation but not change your structure.
- You must be a calm wave in a scary storm.
# YWAM - 8th Week - 3-1 - PRAYER - DANIEL - STU

Our most valuable thing is our private prayer times.
When no one is looking, when no one knows you are praying.

Pray without ceasing.
When you have a prayer evening, take the clocks off the walls and pray until you are done praying.

Imagine Daniel:
He was one of 4 people who was Christian in the whole city.
He served 4 pagan Kings who thought of themselves as God and hated the Christian God but by the end of all of their reigns each one of them declared God as the one true God.

In Chapter 1 Daniel is 15 years old.
By Chapter 6 Daniel had already been already been serving in Babylon for 66 years.
He is most likely around 80 years old when he is thrown in the lions den.

> “It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom 120 satraps, to be throughout the whole kingdom; and over them three high officials, of whom Daniel was one, to whom these satraps should give account, so that the king might suffer no loss. Then this Daniel became distinguished above all the other high officials and satraps, because an excellent spirit was in him. And the king planned to set him over the whole kingdom. Then the high officials and the satraps sought to find a ground for complaint against Daniel with regard to the kingdom, but they could find no ground for complaint or any fault, because he was faithful, and no error or fault was found in him.”
‭‭==Daniel‬ ‭6‬:‭1‬-‭4‬ ‭ESV‬‬==

Daniel was so good he got put above all the other officials.
While in politics it is so easy to become corrupt.
Yet through the 66 years he served, they could find NO FAULT.

> “Then these men said, “We shall not find any ground for complaint against this Daniel unless we find it in connection with the law of his God.”
‭‭==Daniel‬ ‭6‬:‭5‬‬ ‭ESV‬‬==

> “Then these high officials and satraps came by agreement to the king and said to him, “O King Darius, live forever! All the high officials of the kingdom, the prefects and the satraps, the counselors and the governors are agreed that the king should establish an ordinance and enforce an injunction, that whoever makes petition to any god or man for thirty days, except to you, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions.”
‭‭==Daniel‬ ‭6‬:‭6‬-‭7‬ ‭ESV‬‬==

Because they found no fault they thought the only thing they can get him with his religion.

> “Now, O king, establish the injunction and sign the document, so that it cannot be changed, according to the law of the Medes and the Persians, which cannot be revoked.” Therefore King Darius signed the document and injunction.”
‭‭==Daniel‬ ‭6‬:‭8‬-‭9‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/dan.6.8-9.ESV

The king signed the doccuments

> “When Daniel knew that the document had been signed, he went to his house where he had windows in his upper chamber open toward Jerusalem. He got down on his knees three times a day and prayed and gave thanks before his God, as he had done previously.”
‭‭==Daniel‬ ‭6‬:‭10‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/dan.6.10.ESV

No matter what happened, Daniel prayed the same.
The situation did not change his schedule.
He was a calm wave in a storm.
He said i don't care what you are going to do, if you are gonna get me, come and get me!

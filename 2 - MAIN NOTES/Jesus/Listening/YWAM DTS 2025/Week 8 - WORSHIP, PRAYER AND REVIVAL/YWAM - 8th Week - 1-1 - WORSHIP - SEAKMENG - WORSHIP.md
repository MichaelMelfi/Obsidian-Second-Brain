# YWAM - 8th Week - WORSHIP - 1-1 - SEAKMENG - WORSHIP

## Why Do We Worship?

Because The Bible tells us to
Because God is worthy or it all
Worship is a living sacrifice to God

## What Does Worship Mean To My Life?

Putting myself down, lifting God up.
Thanking him for saving me and everything he has done in my life, families life and everyone else’s life.
It puts God back in the centre of my thoughts and actions.
It shows others who my king is.
Time for me and God, For Him speak to me, realine me and direct me.

## Gods Holiness

> “And the four living creatures, each of them with six wings, are full of eyes all around and within, and day and night they never cease to say, 
> “Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord God Almighty, who was and is and is to come!” 
> And whenever the living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to him who is seated on the throne, who lives forever and ever, the twenty-four elders fall down before him who is seated on the throne and worship him who lives forever and ever. They cast their crowns before the throne, saying, 
> “Worthy are you, our Lord and God, to receive glory and honor and power, for you created all things, and by your will they existed and were created.””
‭‭==Revelation‬ ‭4‬:‭8‬-‭11‬ ‭ESV‬‬==

> “And all the angels were standing around the throne and around the elders and the four living creatures, and they fell on their faces before the throne and worshiped God, saying, “Amen! Blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and honor and power and might be to our God forever and ever! Amen.””

> “And let them make me a sanctuary, that I may dwell in their midst. Exactly as I show you concerning the pattern of the tabernacle, and of all its furniture, so you shall make it.”

> “All this is from God, who through Christ reconciled us to himself and gave us the ministry of reconciliation; that is, in Christ God was reconciling the world to himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and entrusting to us the message of reconciliation. Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ, God making his appeal through us. We implore you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God.”
‭‭==2 Corinthians‬ ‭5‬:‭18‬-‭20‬ ‭ESV‬‬==

## Gods Beauty

Picture this.
> “Then I turned to see the voice that was speaking to me, and on turning I saw seven golden lampstands, and in the midst of the lampstands one like a son of man, clothed with a long robe and with a golden sash around his chest. The hairs of his head were white, like white wool, like snow. His eyes were like a flame of fire, his feet were like burnished bronze, refined in a furnace, and his voice was like the roar of many waters.”
‭‭==Revelation‬ ‭1‬:‭12‬-‭15‬ ‭ESV‬‬==

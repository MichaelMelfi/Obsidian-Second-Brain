# YWAM - 8th Week - 4-1 - Speaking in Tongues

the meaning of the word tongues is “Prayer language”

Where do they all pray in tongues?
Acts 2
Acts 19
### What are the different tongues?
- Private spiritual prayer language (Just for myself)
1 Corinthians 14:2-4
Romans 8:26

- A sign to non-believers (like in acts where you speak a language you can’t usually speak)
Acts 2:4-13

- For interpretation
1 Corinthians 12:10
1 Corinthians 14:13

### SPIRITUAL PRIVATE PRAYER LANGUAGE
> “For one who speaks in a tongue speaks not to men but to God; for no one understands him, but he utters mysteries in the Spirit.”
‭‭==1 Corinthians‬ ‭14‬:‭2‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/1co.14.2.ESV

> “Likewise the Spirit helps us in our weakness. For we do not know what to pray for as we ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words.”
‭‭==Romans‬ ‭8‬:‭26‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/rom.8.26.ESV

When we speak in the spiritual prayer language we are speaking to God and no one will understand you except for God
We do not gain anything in our mind but our spirit gets stronger!

1 Corinthians 12 Spiritual Gifts
1 Corinthians 13 Love Of God
1 Corinthians 14 Prophecy and tongues

Paul talks about spiritual gifts and that we should have a desire for the spiritual gifts HOWEVER Gods love is greater!
> “Pursue love, and earnestly desire the spiritual gifts, especially that you may prophesy.”
==‭‭1 Corinthians‬ ‭14‬:‭1‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/1co.14.1.ESV

Jackie Pullinger:
Her whole ministry was built on tongues!
After a year no one got saved but When she started speaking in tongues people started getting saved!

### Why speak in tongues?
1. It helps us to pray
It is almost like when we pray in tongues and in normal and hop between the two.
We are interpreting our own tongues (spiritual tongue)
We know when we are praying in tongues we are praying a perfect prayer


2. It strengthens our spirit
> “But you, beloved, building yourselves up in your most holy faith and praying in the Holy Spirit,”
‭‭==Jude‬ ‭1‬:‭20‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/jud.1.20.ESV
It is a spirit getting strengthened not our body or mind.
It is not that anything in the physical is different but things in the spiritual is different.

Paul said he prayed in the spirit and in words he understands
He also sings in the spirit and in his own words.

Some people think that if you are a Christian you have to speak in tongues
Others think that speaking in tongues is not from God but from Satan.
But both are wrong!


### Spiritual Gifts

The bible says that the gift is available for everyone who is a Christian but not everyone has the gift yet.
It is just one of the gifts.
It is not that if you don’t speak in tongues you don't have the Holy Spirit.
You have the Holy Spirit when you accept Jesus into your life but the spiritual gifts are things that you can get through the Holy Spirit.

> “To each is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good. For to one is given through the Spirit the utterance of wisdom, and to another the utterance of knowledge according to the same Spirit, to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healing by the one Spirit, to another the working of miracles, to another prophecy, to another the ability to distinguish between spirits, to another various kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues. All these are empowered by one and the same Spirit, who apportions to each one individually as he wills.”
‭‭==1 Corinthians‬ ‭12‬:‭7‬-‭11‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/1co.12.7-11.ESV

### Great Commission and who else speaks in tongues

It says you will speak in tongues in the great Commision!!!!!

> “And he said to them, “Go into all the world and proclaim the gospel to the whole creation. Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned. And these signs will accompany those who believe: in my name they will cast out demons; they will speak in new tongues; they will pick up serpents with their hands; and if they drink any deadly poison, it will not hurt them; they will lay their hands on the sick, and they will recover.””
‭‭==Mark‬ ‭16‬:‭15‬-‭18‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/mrk.16.15-18.ESV

Peter, Paul and all the churches he planted, all the disciples and all the 400 first Christians

Paul writes:
> “I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you.”
‭‭==1 Corinthians‬ ‭14‬:‭18‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/1co.14.18.ESV



### How do you receive the gift of tongues?

1. Simply asking God on your own

> “What father among you, if his son asks for a fish, will instead of a fish give him a serpent; or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion? If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will the Heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!””
‭‭==Luke‬ ‭11‬:‭11‬-‭13‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/luk.11.13.ESV

This is saying, if you ask God for something He will not give you a demon but He will give you something from Him.

You do not even need anyone to pray for you but can be in your room and asking God for it.


2. It can also be from the laying on with hands.

> “And he said to them, “Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?” And they said, “No, we have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit.” And he said, “Into what then were you baptized?” They said, “Into John’s baptism.” And Paul said, “John baptized with the baptism of repentance, telling the people to believe in the one who was to come after him, that is, Jesus.” On hearing this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. And when Paul had laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they began speaking in tongues and prophesying. There were about twelve men in all. And he entered the synagogue and for three months spoke boldly, reasoning and persuading them about the kingdom of God. But when some became stubborn and continued in unbelief, speaking evil of the Way before the congregation, he withdrew from them and took the disciples with him, reasoning daily in the hall of Tyrannus. This continued for two years, so that all the residents of Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks.”
‭‭==Acts‬ ‭19‬:‭2‬-‭10‬ ‭ESV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/59/act.19.2-10.ESV

Praying for someone to receive the gift of tongues.

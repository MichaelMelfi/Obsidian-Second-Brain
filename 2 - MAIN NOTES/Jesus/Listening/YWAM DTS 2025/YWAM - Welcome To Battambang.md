One Nation and one Church 

What does that mean?

One nation can change the course of one generation.

And one generation can change the course of one nation.



One Nation one Generation

John‬ ‭17‬:‭22‬-‭23‬ ‭NKJV‬‬
“And the glory which You gave Me I have given them, that they may be one just as We are one: I in them, and You in Me; that they may be made perfect in one, and that the world may know that You have sent Me, and have loved them as You have loved Me.”


Isaiah‬ ‭40‬:‭30‬-‭31‬ ‭NKJV‬‬
“Even the youths shall faint and be weary, And the young men shall utterly fall, But those who wait on the Lord Shall renew their strength; They shall mount up with wings like eagles, They shall run and not be weary, They shall walk and not faint.”

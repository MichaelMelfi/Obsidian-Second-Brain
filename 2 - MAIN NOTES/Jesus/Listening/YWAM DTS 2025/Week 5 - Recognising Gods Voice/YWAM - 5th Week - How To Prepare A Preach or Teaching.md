Title: All In
Bible Verse: Matthew 21, Matthew 26:6
Intro:
Story:
V
V
Both of these stories, they knew the value of Jesus.
She did not leave any of the oil in the pot!
She pored it all out, not holding any back.
Even the Disciples forgot how valuable He was and they spent all day every day with him!
They became complacent and used to his presence.

What is Jesus worth to you?
We are not half in half out Christians.
Are you willing to lay everything you have down at his feet and give everything up?
Are you willing to pour out your all and hold nothing back?

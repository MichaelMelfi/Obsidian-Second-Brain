# YWAM - 5th Week - RECOGNISING GODS VOICE 4-1 - John Billis - Intercession Prayers and Spiritual Warfare

### BIBLICAL DEFINITION FOR INTERCESSION
==**Standing in the gap in order to pray according to God’s will for those we are interceding for**==

##### Intercession is getting Gods Heart For This World

### Hearing Gods voice and intercession to hand in hand

For Gods people - True intercession focus on God’s interest for the lost in this world.
God needs us to intercede for all people.
May our prayers turn from our private interest to care for Gods interest.
“Friends care about what friends care about”

Intercession becomes an intimate conversation with God according to Gods heart.
Abraham was called, by God, a friend of God
> ““But you, Israel, are My servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, The descendants of Abraham My friend.”
==‭‭Isaiah‬ ‭41‬:‭8‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/isa.41.8.NKJV
Learn to fellowship with the Lord. Learn to linger in His presence


> “Then the Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every intent of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. And the Lord was sorry that He had made man on the earth, and He was grieved in His heart.”
==‭‭Genesis‬ ‭6‬:‭5‬-‭6‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/gen.6.5-6.NKJV

The impact of corporate intercession will be to the degree we succeed in private intercession.

## What Does Intercession Accomplish?
- It moves the heart of God
- It works in the hearts of others
- It changes our hearts


## What Is Spiritual Warfare?
- Hearing the voice of God to know if and how we deal with the enemy. (Saves time and the temptation to look under every rock for the enemy)
- Joining with God, and others to see the enemy pushed back.
- Being obedient to what God says to do or not

## What Is Spiritual Warfare Not?
- A scary, weird experience
- Dependant on what our flesh says rather than the Spirit
- Making every situation the enemy’s doing
- A self confidence that we can move into any demonic situation 
> “Now God worked unusual miracles by the hands of Paul, so that even handkerchiefs or aprons were brought from his body to the sick, and the diseases left them and the evil spirits went out of them. Then some of the itinerant Jewish exorcists took it upon themselves to call the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had evil spirits, saying, “We exorcise you by the Jesus whom Paul preaches.” Also there were seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, who did so. And the evil spirit answered and said, “Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are you?” Then the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, overpowered them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded. This became known both to all Jews and Greeks dwelling in Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified. And many who had believed came confessing and telling their deeds. Also, many of those who had practiced magic brought their books together and burned them in the sight of all. And they counted up the value of them, and it totaled fifty thousand pieces of silver. So the word of the Lord grew mightily and prevailed.”
==‭‭Acts‬ ‭19‬:‭11‬-‭20‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/act.19.11-20.NKJV

They thought that could use the name of Jesus without knowing its power!

There isn’t a specific method to anything, you cannot use the same things for every battle or situation because it will not work on everything.
You must listen to God about that specific situation.

## Our Weapons For Warfare

‭‭==Mark‬ ‭16‬:‭17‬-‭18‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/mrk.16.17-18.NKJV

https://bible.com/bible/114/1jn.2.2.NKJV

## Principles For Effective Intercession
**PRINCIPLES ARE NOT STEPS, Steps are a formula, principles are advice and guidelines.**
It is all about your life style, people should look at you and see Jesus.

- **Points 1 and 2** [[IMG_5620.jpg]]
- **Points 3 and 4** [[IMG_5621.jpg]]
   1. If the Holy Spirit is in us, we do not need to wait for the Holy Spirit to enter a room as the Holy Spirit is already in us! Pray that He revealed himself more and more.
   2.  The enemy does not want you do have personal time with God.
- **Points 5 and 6 and 7** [[IMG_5622.jpg]]
   1. Give your imagination to God.
   2. Always go into a pray session remembering how remarkable God is. If a prayer session is boring, not powerful or dry, it is not Gods fault as he is remarkable and amazing but your own fault.

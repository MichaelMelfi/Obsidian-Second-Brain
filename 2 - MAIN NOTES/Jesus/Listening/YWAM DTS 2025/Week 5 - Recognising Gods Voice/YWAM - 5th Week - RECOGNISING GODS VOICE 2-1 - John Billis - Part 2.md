> “The Lord says, “I will guide you along the best pathway for your life. I will advise you and watch over you.”
‭‭==Psalms‬ ‭32‬:‭8‬ ‭NLT‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/116/psa.32.8.NLT

This is a promise from God so it is 100% truth and 100% going to happen if you allow it.

> “Your own ears will hear him. Right behind you a voice will say, “This is the way you should go,” whether to the right or to the left.”
‭‭==Isaiah‬ ‭30‬:‭21‬ ‭NLT‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/116/isa.30.21.NLT

Your OWN EARS will hear Him.

> “Pilate therefore said to Him, “Are You a king then?” Jesus answered, “You say rightly that I am a king. For this cause I was born, and for this cause I have come into the world, that I should bear witness to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth hears My voice.””
‭‭==John‬ ‭18‬:‭37‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/jhn.18.37.NKJV

##### What is the truth?
Those who believes and as Jesus is.

All of these are promises to you that you will hear the voice of God and the voice of God can be heard by anyone who believes (is of the truth)


### Four Distant Voices We Hear
1. The Voice Of The Lord
 - Words of authority
 - Conviction
 - Alines with Gods word

2. Voice Of Others
 - It is personal for each person
 - We serve a God that is relational, We cannot go to others to find out what God says and how to hear it. You can go to others to confirm a word you’ve got but you can’t depend on their word for you

3. Voice Of Self
 - Is it me or God?
 - You must read and learn about the character of God otherwise you wont know if it is you or God

4. Voice Of The Enemy
 - Greedy, Jealousy, Condemnation
 - It is not always loud, it can be subtle
 - The enemy can quote scripture to you but even when Satan tried to tempt Jesus the scriptures he quoted were out of context, about control and manipulated

## The Voice Of Self
> “He who trusts in his own heart is a fool, But whoever walks wisely will be delivered.”
==‭‭Proverbs‬ ‭28‬:‭26‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/pro.28.26.NKJV

This says that if you trust in yourself, you are a fool
Trust only in God
“As a dog returns to its own vomit, a man returns to his own sin.”

> “O Lord, I know the way of man is not in himself; It is not in man who walks to direct his own steps.”
‭‭==Jeremiah‬ ‭10‬:‭23‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/jer.10.23.NKJV

Do not trust in your own ways.

> ““For My thoughts are not your thoughts, Nor are your ways My ways,” says the Lord. “For as the heavens are higher than the earth, So are My ways higher than your ways, And My thoughts than your thoughts.”
‭‭==Isaiah‬ ‭55‬:‭8‬-‭9‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/isa.55.8-9.NKJV

God chooses to speak to us, with all His power and authority and might, he chooses to speak to me????

> “Keep back Your servant also from presumptuous sins; Let them not have dominion over me. Then I shall be blameless, And I shall be innocent of great transgression.”
‭‭==Psalms‬ ‭19‬:‭13‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/psa.19.13.NKJV

==Presumption is a sin!==
- Do not presume or assume anything!
- You must seek God before doing anything
- Yes, in religious contexts, particularly within Christianity, "presumption" is considered a sin, meaning it is an act of acting without proper authority or assuming something that is not guaranteed, often referring to over-reliance on God's mercy without genuine repentance or effort to live righteously; essentially taking God's grace for granted.

> “So Jesus explained, “I tell you the truth, the Son can do nothing by himself. He does only what he sees the Father doing. Whatever the Father does, the Son also does.”
‭‭==John‬ ‭5‬:‭19‬ ‭NLT‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/116/jhn.5.19.NLT

> “Then Jesus said to them, “When you lift up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am He, and that I do nothing of Myself; but as My Father taught Me, I speak these things.”
‭‭==John‬ ‭8‬:‭28‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/jhn.8.28.NKJV

These two verses show that Jesus only does what the Father tells Him to do.

##### Why does God sometimes speak through other people and not directly to us?
He does this maybe because we are not listening and has to speak through someone else to get our attention!


## Some of the ways God speaks

1. **THE INNER VOICE** 
- A still small Voice
- A whisper

> “My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me.”
‭‭==John‬ ‭10‬:‭27‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/jhn.10.27.NKJV

> “and after the earthquake a fire, but the Lord was not in the fire; and after the fire a still small voice.”
==‭‭I Kings‬ ‭19‬:‭12‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/1ki.19.12.NKJV

Don’t just look at the big things, listen for the small things that other people will miss.


2. **DIRECTLY FROM THE WORD**
- Scripture Verse
- Reference Number
- Page Number
- Plop Method (Open the bible at a random point)

> “All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness,”
==‭‭II Timothy‬ ‭3‬:‭16‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/2ti.3.16.NKJV

This method keeps us anchored, we know its truth, we know its the word of God, we know that it is alive, a two edged sword.
Jesus is the word so to understand God speaking, we have to be open to Him speaking through the word.


3. **THE RHEMA WORD OF GOD**
- The living voice of God
- The alive word of God
- The now word of God for you

> “So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.”
‭‭==Romans‬ ‭10‬:‭17‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/rom.10.17.NKJV

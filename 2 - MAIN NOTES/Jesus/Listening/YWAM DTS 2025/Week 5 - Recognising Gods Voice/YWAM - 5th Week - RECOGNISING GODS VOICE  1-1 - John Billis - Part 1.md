#### When did Jesus become noire than just a name to you?
2-3 years ago when I started to have a personal relationship with Him

1. Spending Time in solitude and prayer
2. Applying Gods Word
3. Living in Gods unconditional love - Personally and for others
4. Maintaining supportive relationship - allowing others to be a check and balance in our lives
5. May we listen well - in a noisy chaotic world. Are we listing to Chaos or Christ
6. Don’t play “The God Card. Spiritual manipulation

### Questions to ask God 
#### (Right down your first impression or word)
Father, Is There Anything You Want To Say To Me Right Now?
Father, What Do you Think Of Me?
Father, What Do You Want Of Me?

Our ability to hear Gods voice all depends on how close we are to Him.

Loving Jesus is not obeying Jesus
It comes from the love for Jesus
The result of loving Jesus

> ““If you love Me, keep My commandments.”
‭‭==John‬ ‭14‬:‭15‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/jhn.14.15.NKJV

> “according to my earnest expectation and hope that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ will be magnified in my body, whether by life or by death.”
‭‭==Philippians‬ ‭1‬:‭20‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/php.1.20.NKJV

STORY:
There was a group from a DTS and they all listened to Gods voice.
the leader goes around the group and asks what they hear
They all had scriptures but there was one guy who said I had a weird voice telling me that I have to do a headstand next to a free.
He had no idea why that was what he heard.

So they went to park and did just that.

There was a man who was praying, and said earlier that day, i do not want to be here anymore.
If i see someone who is doing a headstand next to a tree i will give my life to you.

The man went to the park and saw the kid doing the headstand next to the tree.
So the kid then lead this man to the lord through prayer etc.

The DTS student did not know why he was doing what he was doing but he trusted God and didn’t ask questions. Just like in the bible when the disciples had to go and get a donkey and didn’t know why Jesus was telling them to get it.

> “Blessed is the man who listens to me, Watching daily at my gates, Waiting at the posts of my doors.”
‭‭==Proverbs‬ ‭8‬:‭34‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/pro.8.34.NKJV

Like a watch guard.
Watch guards would spend day at night at a post waiting for intruders or people wanting to enter the kingdom/castle.
Imagine you left your post and stopping looking out for God and that is the time he comes to the castle/kingdom!
DO NOT LEAVE YOUR POST, God might come at that time.

> “Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim Zophim, of the mountains of Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite. And he had two wives: the name of one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children. This man went up from his city yearly to worship and sacrifice to the Lord of hosts in Shiloh. Also the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the Lord, were there. And whenever the time came for Elkanah to make an offering, he would give portions to Peninnah his wife and to all her sons and daughters. But to Hannah he would give a double portion, for he loved Hannah, although the Lord had closed her womb. And her rival also provoked her severely, to make her miserable, because the Lord had closed her womb. So it was, year by year, when she went up to the house of the Lord, that she provoked her; therefore she wept and did not eat. Then Elkanah her husband said to her, “Hannah, why do you weep? Why do you not eat? And why is your heart grieved? Am I not better to you than ten sons?” So Hannah arose after they had finished eating and drinking in Shiloh. Now Eli the priest was sitting on the seat by the doorpost of the tabernacle of the Lord. And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed to the Lord and wept in anguish.”
==‭‭I Samuel‬ ‭1‬:‭1‬-‭10‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/1sa.1.1-10.NKJV

He heard the voice of God and his life was drastically altered.
IT WAS IN HIS SLEEP, It can be a dream that God speaks through.

> “Trust in the Lord with all your heart, And lean not on your own understanding; In all your ways acknowledge Him, And He shall direct your paths.”
‭‭==Proverbs‬ ‭3‬:‭5‬-‭6‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/pro.3.5-6.NKJV

It is hard to trust God 100%!

> “But without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him.”
‭‭==Hebrews‬ ‭11‬:‭6‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/heb.11.6.NKJV

Four different translations for this verse:
 - DILIGENTLY
 - EARNESTLY
 - SINCERELY
 - SERIOUSLY SEARCH
This is not casual seeking! 
You must go out of your way with all of you and seek Him.

> “So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.”
‭‭==Romans‬ ‭10‬:‭17‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/rom.10.17.NKJV

### Key verses for hearing Gods voice
> “To him the doorkeeper opens, and the sheep hear his voice; and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. And when he brings out his own sheep, he goes before them; and the sheep follow him, for they know his voice. Yet they will by no means follow a stranger, but will flee from him, for they do not know the voice of strangers.””
‭‭==John‬ ‭10‬:‭3‬-‭5‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/jhn.10.3-5.NKJV

> “My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me. And I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; neither shall anyone snatch them out of My hand. My Father, who has given them to Me, is greater than all; and no one is able to snatch them out of My Father’s hand. I and My Father are one.””
‭‭==John‬ ‭10‬:‭27‬-‭30‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/jhn.10.27-30.NKJV

It says Sheep.
It does not say pastor or anything else.
It says sheep, meaning ANYONE can hear Gods voice.

(He showed a video of people trying to call sheep and the sheep not doing anything then the Shepard calling the sheep and they all come.)

We are Gods Sheep and He is the Shepard.

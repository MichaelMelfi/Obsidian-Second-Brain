## Other Ways God speaks:

### - Inner Peace

> “He is the Holy Spirit, who leads into all truth. The world cannot receive him, because it isn’t looking for him and doesn’t recognize him. But you know him, because he lives with you now and later will be in you.”
‭‭==John‬ ‭14‬:‭17‬ ‭NLT‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/116/jhn.14.17.NLT

> “For his Spirit joins with our spirit to affirm that we are God’s children.”
‭‭==Romans‬ ‭8‬:‭16‬ ‭NLT‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/116/rom.8.16.NLT

> “Then you will experience God’s peace, which exceeds anything we can understand. His peace will guard your hearts and minds as you live in Christ Jesus.”
‭‭==Philippians‬ ‭4‬:‭7‬ ‭NLT‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/116/php.4.7.NLT

- You must have peace in situations, if you do not know if you should do something, ask God to increase your peace in the situation if it is the right decision.


### - Other Members Of The Body Of Christ

> “And Ananias went his way and entered the house; and laying his hands on him he said, “Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus, who appeared to you on the road as you came, has sent me that you may receive your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit.””
‭‭==Acts‬ ‭9‬:‭17‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/act.9.17.NKJV

- As we are all part of the body of Christ, we should all feel the same about a situation as God speaks through us all in the same way.


### - Through Animals
THIS IS NOT NORMAL, THERE IS ONLY ONE INSTANCE IN THE BIBLE WHERE THIS HAPPENS.
THE MAIN WAY IS THROUGH THE BIBLE.

> “So the donkey said to Balaam, “Am I not your donkey on which you have ridden, ever since I became yours, to this day? Was I ever disposed to do this to you?” And he said, “No.””
‭‭==Numbers‬ ‭22‬:‭30‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/num.22.30.NKJV

### - Visions

> “After these things the word of the Lord came to Abram in a vision, saying, “Do not be afraid, Abram. I am your shield, your exceedingly great reward.””
==‭‭Genesis‬ ‭15‬:‭1‬ ‭NKJV==‬‬
https://bible.com/bible/114/gen.15.1.NKJV

> “Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, on the fifth day of the month, as I was among the captives by the River Chebar, that the heavens were opened and I saw visions of God.”
‭‭==Ezekiel‬ ‭1‬:‭1‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/ezk.1.1.NKJV

> “Daniel spoke, saying, “I saw in my vision by night, and behold, the four winds of heaven were stirring up the Great Sea.”
‭‭==Daniel‬ ‭7‬:‭2‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/dan.7.2.NKJV

### - Dreams

THE STORY OF JOSEPH IN EXODUS

> “‘And it shall come to pass in the last days, says God, That I will pour out of My Spirit on all flesh; Your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, Your young men shall see visions, Your old men shall dream dreams.”
‭‭==Acts‬ ‭2‬:‭17‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/act.2.17.NKJV

> “Now when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, “Arise, take the young Child and His mother, flee to Egypt, and stay there until I bring you word; for Herod will seek the young Child to destroy Him.””
‭‭==Matthew‬ ‭2‬:‭13‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/mat.2.13.NKJV

You must go to God with all your dreams to determine if it is from Him.
Be careful what you tell people.
### - Angels

> ““Behold, I send an Angel before you to keep you in the way and to bring you into the place which I have prepared.”
‭‭==Exodus‬ ‭23‬:‭20‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/exo.23.20.NKJV

> “So Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.”
‭‭==Genesis‬ ‭32‬:‭1‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/gen.32.1.NKJV

Do not pray to see an angel!
A preacher once said that he does not want to see an angel because if he did then it would rewind his faith 10 years.
### - Songs

THE WHOLE OF PSALMS

> ““Now therefore, write down this song for yourselves, and teach it to the children of Israel; put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for Me against the children of Israel.”
‭‭==Deuteronomy‬ ‭31‬:‭19‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/deu.31.19.NKJV

### - Gifts

> “Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, let us use them: if prophecy, let us prophesy in proportion to our faith; or ministry, let us use it in our ministering; he who teaches, in teaching; he who exhorts, in exhortation; he who gives, with liberality; he who leads, with diligence; he who shows mercy, with cheerfulness.”
‭‭==Romans‬ ‭12‬:‭6‬-‭8‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/rom.12.6-8.NKJV

> “There are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit. There are differences of ministries, but the same Lord. And there are diversities of activities, but it is the same God who works all in all. But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to each one for the profit of all: for to one is given the word of wisdom through the Spirit, to another the word of knowledge through the same Spirit, to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healings by the same Spirit, to another the working of miracles, to another prophecy, to another discerning of spirits, to another different kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues. But one and the same Spirit works all these things, distributing to each one individually as He wills.”
==‭‭I Corinthians‬ ‭12‬:‭4‬-‭11‬ ‭NKJV‬‬==
https://bible.com/bible/114/1co.12.4-11.NKJV



## Tests Of Truth

### Does it Glorify Christ

### Does It Bear Witness Of Elders?

### Does It Bear Witness with your own spirit?

### If you heard something that puts question mark in your mind causes you to drown back-stop

### Does it bind you up, rather than set you free? THE TRUTH ALWAYS SETS YOU FREE

# YWAM - 5th Week - RECOGNSING GODS VOICE 4-1 - John Billis - How To Bring Enthusiasm Into Intersession

Spending the time to listen to God to discover what His heart is for the nations
- **Known** (Things that the world knows)
- **Unknown** (Things that God tell your specifically that the world doesn’t know)
   - Revealed knowledge of God

Spend more time with God as He can reveals things to us that he wants to reveal to us.
It is a privilege to hear and listen to God!

This Intersession prayer time is specifically and focused on listening to everyone else, you DO NOT pray at the same time, you pray one at a time because God might ask you to add onto what the person before you prays about.
### Practical Suggestions:

When discovering the direction the Lord wants to pray, have lots of conversation in the group with your eyes open.
Find a theme and a target for the Intercession as a group.
1. The Theme is the what you want to happen, E.G. Healing, revival.
2. The Target is a nation / country or a specific group of people. (This keeps is centred and not random ideas coming out and jumping around.)
3. Don’t spend too long waiting in silence in the group waiting for God to speak, 60 seconds? (The longer we wait the more our mind might wonder onto things like dinner or your imagination will take over. Trust the first impression, God doesn’t want to make it difficult for you)
4. Trust that the first impression you have is the Lord
5. Expect each person to participate
6. Don’t move onto a new topic until you have properly ASKED God to do something, Do not jump between topics quickly.
7. [[IMG_5659.jpg]] We would rather have a sniper shot that that hits head centre than a shotgun that sprays everywhere. Get details and keep pressing in make sure you have prayed and declared everything about that topic and not left anything out.
8. When someone else is praying, we listen and enter in, in agreement
9. Be always asking God “What is it that you want me to pray?”
10. Pray short specific prayers DO NOT PREACH through the prayer. Everyone is as valuable as you and is part of the Body Of Christ JUST LIKE YOU, so do not take up the whole time.
11. Make sure you’re listening for the Lord direction on How to Pray…. Not the obvious information you’ve gathered.
